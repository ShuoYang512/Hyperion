### dataset

This directory contains the datasets used in the experimental section of the paper. where

- `fine_tune`: A dataset for fine-tuning large models.
- `risky_DAPPs`: A dataset for testing the effectiveness of detection tools. It contains labeled dapps (ground truth).
- `wilds`: A dataset for large-scale experiment. It contains unlabeled dapps (wild).
- `HtmlTextExtractor`: a tool for automatically crawl the website raw text from a given url, serving as a helper.
- `inconsistency_map.csv`: the mapping csv that shows the problematic DApp with its inconsistency type.

We have a readme in each dataset directory.

Due to the storage limit of Github larget files, we put our DApp datasets to the anonymous google drive.

The 3 datasets' links are follow:

To illutrate our structure of DApp dataset, we put a sample case in directory `sample`.
