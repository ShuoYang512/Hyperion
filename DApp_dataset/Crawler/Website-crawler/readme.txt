
This script is designed to scrape and save the frontend code of Dapp websites whose links have been previously saved by the Dappradar-crawler in 'link.txt' files. It uses Selenium for web scraping. Here's how to use the script:

### Setup and Requirements
1. **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Selenium Library**: Install Selenium by running `pip install selenium`.
3. **Requests Library**: Install Requests by running `pip install requests`.
4. **ChromeDriver**: Install ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser's version and ensure it's in your system path.

### Configuring the Script
- Set the `user_data_path` in the script to your Chrome user data directory to allow Selenium to use your existing Chrome profile.
- Modify the `base_path` variable in the script to the directory where your 'link.txt' files are stored. This path is where the script will look for web pages to scrape.

### Running the Script
- Execute the script. It will read each 'link.txt' file in the specified directory, visit the corresponding web page, and scrape its HTML and images.
- The script will save the HTML source code of each page in an 'index.html' file and download all images, saving them as 'image_{i}.jpg', where `{i}` is a sequential number.

### Notes
- The script will print the status of each operation, including successes and any errors encountered.
- Ensure you have the right to scrape the websites and comply with legal and ethical guidelines.
- A stable internet connection is required for the script to function properly.
