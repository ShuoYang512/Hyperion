### sample_DApp

We use the DApp `BNB Pirates` to illustrate the structure of collected DApp dataset (This DApp is unaccessible when we writing this paper).

- `BNB Pirates 3% by BSC Pirates_files` and `BNB Pirates 3% by BSC Pirates_files.html` shows the webpage resources.

- `bnbpirates.sol` shows the backend smart contract.

- `expected.txt` shows the expected output of description analysis that we labeled. For example, we want to extract reward **3%** from the frontend.

- `test.txt` is the input text information to the llm.
