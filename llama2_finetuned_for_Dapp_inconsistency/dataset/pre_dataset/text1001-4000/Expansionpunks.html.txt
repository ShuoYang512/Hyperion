OpenSea RARITY DISCOVER see our explorers About ExpansionPunks ExpansionPunks is a collection of 10K unique, procedurally-generated collectible Punks stored as ERC721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. In the same way "expansion packs" introduce new characters and storylines in traditional tabletop gaming, ExpansionPunks have arrived to expand the Punkverse to be a more diverse and inclusive community by addressing subtle biases in the original CryptoPunks collection that unintentionally lead to exclusion. The ExpansionPunks collection features a gender distribution that inverses disparities in the original collection resulting in an aggregate 20K collection (10K CryptoPunks + 10K ExpansionPunks) that better reflects the real world. Token ownership is your share-of-voice in the ExpansionDAO, a self-governing organization that will empower the community to direct our policies and Expansion Treasury investments.

The PunkExplorer offers the community an immersive visual experience for navigating, sorting and filtering the entire collection. Below are some of the near-term priorities for the Explorer: Add dynamic data (e.g. Price, owner address, etc.) and use for filtering Enable shareable links to send around views and filter results Add computed meta data (e.g attribute rarity) Bring the NFT Explorer experience to other collections and artists. Mobile friendly explorer ExpansionDAO Owning an ExpansionPunk is your membership into the ExpansionPunk community. We believe that decentralization and community involvement is the only way to go forward with this collection. The foundation for this principle is the ExpansionDAO Treasury, funded with 34% of all primary sales as well as all ongoing secondary royalties (1%). Token ownership represents a voice in the forthcoming ExpansionDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that will allow community members to direct the future of ExpansionPunks. Owning an ExpansionPunk token does not grant individuals with an expectation of profit from the Community Treasury. Sold out. Get yours on Opensea! OpenSea Sold out. Get yours on Opensea!
