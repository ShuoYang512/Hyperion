Lizard Exchange is an automated market-making (AMM) decentralized trading platform with low fees, high-speed transactions, providing liquidity and enabling peer-to-peer transactions on Oasis Network. We expect to become the leading DEX and be the entrance door to many innovative DeFi projects. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and convenient, one-stop platform for the cryptocurrency community. Why Lizard exchange? Fair Launch To reinforce the project’s commitment to being created solely for the benefit of users, Lizard Exchange is following a fair launch model. There are no pre-sales, private sales or pre-listing allocations of the LIZ token. To account for the sustainability, a part of the trading fees will be used to buy back and support our token. Earn Trading Fees via Liquidity Pools By providing liquidity, you will also generate extra rewards through trading fees. Every time a user makes a swap, a part of the operation fees will be distributed to our Liquidity Providers Peer-to-Peer transactions Trade directly from wallet to wallet, without any third party account or releasing custody of your tokens.
