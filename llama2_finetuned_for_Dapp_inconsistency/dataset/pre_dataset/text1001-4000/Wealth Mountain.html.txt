Getting involved Liquid Staking Absolutely risk-free with proportional rewards! Have access to your stake at any point with zero chance of overlap with rewards. Liquid Stakes sit in an isolated pool and remain untouched for the duration of your stake. Rewards are proportional to your staking amount. The more you stake, the larger your share in the Liquid Staking pool to earn a portion of Liquidity Injections. No reliance on new stakes or capital. If users choose to unstake, existing stakers earn more. Alternatively, creating new stakes allow the Wealth Portfolio to grow and generate more revenue. Split Staking Purchase split stakes and earn split rewards! Purchase a Split Stake to deploy your capital via the Wealth Portfolio. Prices are determined by the Wealth Mountain Smart Contracts, as dictated by project activity. Rewards are evenly distributed amongst all Split Stakes. The more Split Stakes you purchase, the more you earn. Users always have the option to sell their Split Stake back to the Wealth Mountain Smart Contracts for a predetermined resale price. Sales of Split Stakes mean more rewards for existing Split Stake holders. Early Adopter Staking We appreciate our Early Adopters and risk-takers that supported the V1 platform! Early Adopter Stakes will enjoy various perks to show gratitude for their support in Wealth Mountain V1. These stakes are locked due to risks taken in V1.
