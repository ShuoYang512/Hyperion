Stake Now &gt;&gt; Join us: Subscribe to our newsletter for latest updates Truly decentralized oracles are here Smart contracts do not have access to external data. Such data is necessary for operation of various decentralized applications. Traditionally this is done by using a centralized servers called “Oracles”. But they are a single point of failure in otherwise decentralized applications and must be trustworthy. Razor Network is a decentralized oracle providing data to the smart contracts using a network of stakers. Razor is not only fast but also extremely robust and economically secure. Whitepaper Explainer Features Truly decentralized End-to-end decentralized oracle network with no centralized bottlenecks Secure Dispute escalation and resolution mechanism makes it extremely resistant to collusion, bribing and censorship attacks Fast Automated fetching of the data without compromising security and decentralization Scalable Deployed on a scalable network and blockchain agnostic. Proof of Stake Secured by highly efficient Proof of Stake network with strict penalties for misbehaviour Ecosystem Get in touch!
