Launch AppDecentralize WalletAs ESwap is a decentralized trading platform built on Ethereum smart contracts, most cryptocurrency wallets applicable to the Ethereum chain may be linked to and used by ESwap, including MetaMask, imToken, Trust Wallet, Huobi Wallets, and so on.No Third PartyThe biggest feature of the decentralized trading platform is the elimination for the participation of third parties and order book in blockchain finance through the usage of Smart Contracts to achieve financial decentralization and matching of order.Liquidity PoolUnlike a centralized trading platform in the form of an order book, there is no order book in ESwap. The exchange rates of tokens are determined by POOL, which means that price fluctuations are determined based on user transaction volume.AMMAutomated Market-MakerProvide LiquidityThe exchange basis of ESwap is entirely derived from liquidity added by Liquidity Providers. This rule shall always apply, therefore, all Liquidity Providers are incentivized to deposit tokens proportionate to market exchange rates. Be a Liquidity ProviderHow It WorksTransactions in general trading platforms and traditional stock markets are conducted via order books, which means that buyers and sellers define their orders separately. Buyers typically want to buy at the lowest price, whilst sellers aim to sell at the highest price. In such situations, both parties may not reach a consensus, rendering transactions incomplete.During such a time, a Market-Maker must appear to facilitate transactions where it will accept buy and sell orders to generate liquidity, thus allowing users to trade without the other party’s appearance.In ESwap, every user may become a Market-Maker or Liquidity Provider (LP) to provide liquidity for ESwap. The LP possess the simple role of creating ETH-stablecoin trading pairs to increase the pair’s reserves. With more ETH reserves, the trading price of stablecoins are more balanced, and paired tokens possess higher liquidity.Protocol OverviewESwap Operation ModeESwap is an automatic Market-Making protocol supported by a Constant Product formula and runs on a non-upgradable Smart Contract system on the Ethereum blockchain. ESwap eliminates the need for intermediaries, therefore achieving decentralization, censorship resistance and security.The automatic Market-Making agreement is like a store with basic functions. In ESwap, the Liquidity Provider plays both the roles recycler and a seller roles. ESwap can provide exchange services for any two ERC20 tokens, but Liquidity Providers are required for this.Liquidity ProviderAnyone can become a Liquidity Provider. Deposit tokens of equal proportions into both sides and receive reward, often referred to as an LP. The amount of LP may be exchanged proportionally according to the amount of assets in the current reserve, which guarantees that the proportion of your deposit will be equal before any transactions are performed. The exchange basis of ESwap is entirely derived from liquidity added by Liquidity Providers. When there are no tokens in the reserve, users may add liquidity in any proportion and the first Liquidity Provider shall be the provider who sets the initial price of the mining pool. Expectedly, a proportionate risk of loss shall also be assumed. For example, if the first Liquidity Provider deposits tokens into the trading pair at a rate different from the current market exchange rate, it immediately creates profitable arbitrage opportunities for other users to easily take advantage of, thus bringing exchange rates back to market prices. This rule shall always apply, therefore, all Liquidity Providers are incentivized to deposit tokens proportionate to market exchange rates.Automated Market-Maker Algorithm The price curve principle of ESwap is simple, X * Y = K, where “X” and “Y” are two types of capital reserves. For example, when you create a reserve token trading pair of Ethereum and USDT at a 100:100 ratio, then its Constant Product is 10,000 and this will not change before new liquidity is added.Therefore, if you use 50 Ethereum to exchange for USDT, the assets received are 150 Ethereum * (100-X) USDT = 10,000, where “X” is the asset received, which is 33.33 USDT. In this instance, an obvious large slippage has occurred, and the only way to reduce this slippage is for more participants to provide liquidity support. If bilateral reserves at this time are 10,000 Ethereum: 10,000 USDT, then the product, “K”, is 100,000,000.During this time, we are still redeeming with 50 Ethereum, and by applying the formula, 10,050 Ethereum * (10000-X) USDT = 100,000,000, and “X” is calculated as 49.75 USDT. With reserves that are large enough, more quantities may be obtained the best price. To attract users in providing liquidity, ESwap shall re-inject 0.4% of the token amounts paid for each exchange into the reserve. Given that, handling fees are shared equally among all liquidity providers, which is one of our value capture methods.Ecosystem ParticipantsThe ESwap ecosystem is mainly comprised of three types of users: Liquidity Providers, Traders and Developers. Liquidity providers are incentivized to contribute tokens to the ordinary liquidity pool. Traders may exchange these tokens for a fixed fee of 0.40% (Liquidity Provider's profit). Developers can jointly develop ESwap and usher in an exciting future for ESwap by improving user experiences, transaction processes, etc.Total SupplyBurned to dateMarket CapCurrent Emissionhello@eswap.tubeAbout usAboutAMMProtocol Overview© 2021 copyright all right reserved by E-swapdisclaimer×LoginRemember MeForgot Password ?LoginDon't have an account?
