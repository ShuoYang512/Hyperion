Bridge Send Transfer from Ethereum Connect Transfer to Aurora Connect I'm transferring to an address other than my own Begin new transfer Scan transfer history Which wallets do you support? Warning! — For Ethereum-compatible wallets,&nbsp;we depend on a third-party wallet connector, who control the contents of the window you see when clicking "Connect". That window contains some wallets that do not support the Aurora network! It's your responsibility to confirm that your wallet supports the Aurora network, before sending funds to Aurora. Currently, we know that MetaMask, &nbsp; Rabby and Brave work on desktop, and Coinbase Wallet on desktop and mobile. If you accidentally send funds to Aurora using a wallet that does not support the network, the recovery solution would be to restore your wallet in MetaMask, using your current wallet's seed phrase.
