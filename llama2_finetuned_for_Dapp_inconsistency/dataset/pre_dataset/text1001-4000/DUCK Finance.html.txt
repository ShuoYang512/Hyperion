Yield made simple App Coming Soon We are Ducks Finance At Ducks Finance, we firmly believe in the power of simplicity as an ingredient for success. Our platform boasts an easy-to-use interface, empowering users to enjoy an attractive APY while benefiting from sustainable tokenomics. We strategically invest the revenues generated in high-yield opportunities, continually compounding our rewards until market conditions are favorable. Our dedicated team manages the funds and adjusts investment allocations based on various factors, aiming to grow the total value of assets under management. We will hold the underlying investments indefinitely, never selling them. Instead, we sell the generated yield (when not compounded) and repurchase Ducks tokens from the open market. We burn a percentage of the tokens, reducing the overall supply and allocating another portion to the community rewards pool. The team will determine the ratio to ensure responsible and sustainable project growth. Our unwavering objective is to steadily increase the value of the Ducks token over the long term, fostering a trajectory of growth that spans years. We are committed to providing our users with a platform that delivers attractive APY and is a testament to simplicity and sustainability.

Firstly, it enablesusers to stake their tokens through our staking dApp and earn passive income on their holdings. Thisfeature allows users to generate a steady yield on their investments. To create a deflationary token model, we have incorporated a mechanism where Ducks Tokens areburned periodically. This reduction in token supply contributes to an increase in the value of eachremaining token. Additionally, a portion of the income generated by our platform will be allocatedto repurchasing Ducks Tokens from the open market. This buyback initiative further supports thedeflationary nature of the token and enhances its overall value. Staking Our staking contract is simple. Behind the scenes we do all the work, so all you have to do is stake your Ducks tokens and watch your holding increase month on month. We have a 1% deposit fee for staking, with no minimum staking period. Users will require Ducks Staking NFTs to unlock each pool. These NFTs are your gateway to long-term yield.
