Is based on the Signidice algorithm and RSA verification. Signidice was chosen for its excellent randomization and non-gameablity characteristics, in addition to yielding a cleaner workflow for dApp developers and being provably fair. RSA verification ensures uniqueness of the signature and removes the ability for the results to be manipulated (if any other type of signing algorithm were used, it would allow many valid signatures for the same signing_value which could result in manipulation). Can easily be established as provably fair. The self-verifying WAX RNG Native Blockchain Service confirms that the RSA signature that comes back from the WAX RNG oracle is valid and authentic before being utilized by the dApp. When dApp customers can easily establish fairness, they have a higher degree of confidence in using the dApp. For more information, check out the WAX blog . Building the smart contract and its unit tests Requirements docker, installed and configured to run without sudo make Build and test # Build the smart contract make docker-build # Run tests npm install npm run test Register bandwidth payer WAX RNG allows dapps to pay for their own bandwidth, which can prevent your dapp from losing service during times of high activity on the rng contract. In the future, WAX will reduce the free bandwidth available for dapps, so it is a good idea to migrate to this to ensure your dapp is always up with respect to random number generation. create new permission name paybw and delegate it to oracle.wax@rngops cleos set account permission payer111111 paybw ' {"threshold":1,"keys":[],"accounts":[{"permission":{"actor":"oracle.wax","permission":"rngops"},"weight":1}]} ' -p payer111111 Allow paybw permission to call boost.wax noop cleos set action permission payer111111 boost.wax noop paybw Dapp register for bandwith payer cleos push action orng.wax setbwpayer ' ["dapp11111111", "payer111111"] ' -p dapp11111111 Payer accept to pay bandwidth cleos push action orng.wax acceptbwpay ' ["dapp11111111", "payer111111", true] ' -p payer111111 Register for error messages log WAX RNG support developer to record error message to smart contract.
