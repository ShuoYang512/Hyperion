We will offer blockchain projects and investors an opportunity to launch in IDOs from multiple chains at the same time, powered by Allbridge’s solution. It increases the availability of projects at SmartPad and carves us a unique place within the DeFi ecosystem. Roadmap A lot of exciting things are coming to SmartPad.
