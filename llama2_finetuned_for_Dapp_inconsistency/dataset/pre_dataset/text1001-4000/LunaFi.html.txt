When submitting a bet, a transparent, auditable escrow contract is created on the blockchain, which settles your bet based on the event outcome. If you win your bet, your funds are automatically transferred into your wallet.When will it launch?We’re targeting July 2022 for our Beta Launch. Click here if you’d like to be one of the founding testers. Beta testers will be rewarded with generous LFI incentives.What is a wallet?A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows you to store and manage cryptocurrencies.

Polygon is a layer-two (L2) scaling platform that leverages the security benefits of ETH and its smart contracts but significantly improves the throughput (tx) capacity to 10,000 transactions per second—making it a more affordable solution due to its competitive gas fees.This is why many notable projects in the DeFi ecosystem have migrated from the ETH mainnet to the Polygon network whilst maintaining backward compatibility with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and adding the efficiency of a Layer 2 solution.What is the SX Network?The SX Network is a stand-alone smart contract blockchain built on the Polygon SDK, which is a modular, flexible framework for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. The SX network is designed from the ground up, especially for sports betting blockchain applications.STAY UP TO DATE WITH ALL THE LATEST NEWSSign up below to receive all the latest updates from LunaFi HQEnter email adressOur community is building a comprehensive decentralized betting platform for the future of finance.
