 We respawn from the other side to start a REVOLUTION! Go to App Go to App What Is PIGS AT WAR? We came back from the other side to start a revolution and fight against slaughter. Before we start the war we need to build alliances to have outposts and find trustful humans to help us. Alliances help us to come off the blockchain and IPFS into the gameworld where we are then able to fight in 3D. To support Pigs &amp; Hogs in this Revolutions humans need to adopt Pigs &amp; Hogs from IPFS and level them up to get ready for the revolution. In addition humans should build farms as bootcamp for the Army but as well to be able to farm and harvest for the war treasury. Your Farm is your homebase for everything coming next. If you have no Farm you can partner up with humans who have one or .... how it works? Humans adopt Pigs &amp; Hogs, Guns and Armory as well buildings from our coordinates on the IPFS at Kalamint.io and also be able to build outposts on gif.games . When humans have adopted a pig or hog or even a baby hog or any other upgradable asset and as well have collected enough resources (Crystals) they come back to our homebase here and connect their war bag. Then options will be shown how to upgrade your Army, Building etc to the next level.

As you see, we took off the Quarters since we learned in the last year, that from time to time we may need to adjust the builts according to the GDD (Game Design Document) what can cause adjustments of priorities and or additions while we build. As we are building a seemless experience on Tezos, where most of the technological complexity is kept "under the hood" to simplify onboarding for the gaming world and to set the GAME Experience in front of everything, we do face technical hurdles while building. Therefore, the roadmap sets the team's most honest intentions, nevertheless, due to the number of technical challenges, it can be adjusted anytime. Anyhow we are working restless since September 2021 to make this happen and nothing can stop us from building. üêΩ #hogstrong PIGS AT WAR TEAM DRAW HOG Art Director / Founder Illustrator with 20+ Years of experience building games and art direction.
