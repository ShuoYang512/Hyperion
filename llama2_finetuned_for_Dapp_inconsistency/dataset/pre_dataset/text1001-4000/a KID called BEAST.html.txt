THIS&nbsp;IS&nbsp;HOW&nbsp;WE&nbsp;ENVISION&nbsp;A&nbsp;KID&nbsp;CALLED&nbsp;BEAST AS&nbsp;A FORMIDABLE&nbsp;BRAND&nbsp;IN&nbsp;EVERY&nbsp;REALITY. THESE&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;OUR FOUR&nbsp;PILLARS&nbsp;IN&nbsp;WHICH&nbsp;WE&nbsp;STAND&nbsp;ON&nbsp;AND LEAD&nbsp;US TO&nbsp;OUR&nbsp;SUCCESS. Digital Digital AR Display IN&nbsp;PROGRESS Metaverse Exploring YEARBOOK Exploring DASHBOARD IN&nbsp;PROGRESS FACE FILTERS IN&nbsp;pROGRESS AR Display Metaverse YEARBOOK DASHBOARD FACE&nbsp;FILTERS The AKCB AR demo was received with overwhelming positivity, with the feature quickly becoming synonymous with the AKCB brand. Thus this feature is going to be heavily expanded on for holders to use with increased functionality with multiple formats and extra features being developed for holders to utilize. These features will be accessible via the dashboard where holders will be able to launch the AKCB AR application. This aspect of the project will be continually seen as a focal point of development moving forward as we wish to employ the most cutting edge AR technologies and integrations into the project long term. For those who do not hold a beast, various event based demos will be available throughout the year to use and show off on social media. IN&nbsp;PROGRESS The AKCB has spent a lot of time analyzing the Metaverse as a value proposition to the AKCB brand. While undoubtedly there is a lot of support and capital pouring into various metaverses, we are yet to see many good uses of the technology and potential. While it would be easy for us to make the model integrate into one of the more popular metaverses we feel as if this would be a subpar utilization. As a result we are in active discussion with various metaverse providers for exciting and unique ways to employ the metaverse to the benefit of the holders and the brand. This phase is very much conceptual and more information will be released when we have determined the best way for AKCB to move into the metaverse space with all the hype and quality it deserves. Exploring The Yearbook is the central hub for holders to learn about the current and past information of each beast owner with information being added voluntarily by each holder. This will allow users to view the full history of each beast’s ownership and any info the current owner wishes to share also. The Yearbook is a complete history of the project which will exist as a gallery and reflection of each holder’s unique personality and appreciation for their beasts. Exploring The dashboard is the personal web3 one stop shop for everything AKCB. From here each AKCB holder will be able to access their assets, exclusive content and the other AKCB utility implementations (PLUS some surprises). From the dashboard you will be able to update your personal holder information, interact with other holders, see exclusive sneak peeks and receive early access to future content. Via the dashboard we want to engineer a truly unique service which allows holders direct access to all features of the project in one place as well as direct correspondence with the team. COMPLETE Social Face Filters have been an increasingly popular part of the project, with the following on both INSTAGRAM and Tiktok enjoying sharing their use of the filter in unique and interesting settings. Due to the reception we've received from this filter we are intending on expanding this aspect of the project and including personal face filters for all holders which will be accessible via the dashboard. We will also be expanding the catalog of the social media face filters to include more options and variants for none holders to use. These will include seasonal and event based variants which will be utilized in competitions and events alongside a corresponding public AR feature.&nbsp; IN&nbsp;PROGRESS Physical Physical toy Exploring CREATIVE CONSUMABLES SHOWROOMs GALLERY LAUNCHPAD FASHION Exploring toy CREATIVE CONSUMABLES SHOWROOMS GALLERY LAUNCHPAD APPAREL Since the project was first revealed to the public, our messages have been flooded with demands for a physical model. We’re glad you are all on the same page as us as this was a feature planned before we went public. We’re already in talks with various potential suppliers and requested PROTOTYPE models which are in production in order to determine which supplier is suitable to provide the quality and care required to bring beasts into the physical realm. The exact price point, accessibility and supply is yet to be determined but updates regarding this side of the project will be made apparent when relevant. IN&nbsp;PROGRESS AKCB is more than an NFT project - we’re a lifestyle brand. As a result we want to have a multitude of exclusive and interesting products where the creative energies of the digital realm are manifested in the physical. A result of this creative process is the idea of AKCB themed consumables. We’re actively looking at working with Japanese candy manufacturers to produce delicious and sustainable AKCB themed sweets, gum, chips, sodas, snacks and more. This will add an extra aspect of the AKCB project that everyone can enjoy. I&nbsp;MEAN.. who doesn’t enjoy food? Exploring Even before the first beast was created, it has been our intention to build a project which can sustain and support spaces in which web3 can manifest in the physical world. We have always wanted to have a boutique web3 highstreet store in major citIES. Our intention is to have a permanent physical location in London, Paris, NYC, Dubai and Tokyo long term. InitialLY the first permanent location is likely to be London. We’re already actively looking at spaces while also looking at potential pop up stalls for various crypto, fashion and music events in the more imminent future. Details regarding these events will be made apparent to holders once they are locked in. Exploring As a brand committed to the creative process and the individuals behind them, we feel it is important to use our platform to elevate art beyond our own creations. This is why we have opted to create a launchpad for the best unknown creatives to showcase their work to our community. The work will include but is not limited to: NFTs, photography, sculpture, clothing, paintings and more. In exchange for this promotion all we will ask for is to own some of their creations ourselves to share out amongst the beast hoods and wider community, thus providing greater visibility also. Exploring As per our commitment to executing every aspect of our project to the highest degree of quality possible, we did not want to run a basic “merch” release with low quality print on demand services like the average project. Instead our team is developing a high end AKCB streetwear brand which will be released in exclusive runs and batches. These exclusive releases will first be available to holders to purchase before the rest of the stock being released to the general public. We are going to cultivate a resell aftermarket for these releases and will be working with various fashion forums and influences to best execute this side of the project.

Whether that's via inspiration, a passing conversation or direct involvement. As part of cultivating AKCB into a global brand we know that we will need the collaboration of others to truly realise our vision. As a result we have already been cultivating partnerships with forward thinking brands, collectives and tech startups in order to continue the growth and expansion of AKCB. Every partnership we make is carefully considered and calculated in order to ensure it is suitable for the brand and community long term, however any other interested parties who may fit the bill can be taken into consideration via the filling out of our contact form on our website. You can also expect partnerships with established content creators who are passionate about the AKCB and its vision also, more information on these will be apparent via the social platforms and newsletter. ON&nbsp;GOING the power of collective communities of individuals and increasing accountability when it comes to SUPPORTING OTHER&nbsp;projects. In accordance to our policy of quality we are CREATING&nbsp;OPPORTUNITIES with the support of experts, FOR&nbsp;OUR COMMUNITY TO&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;ACCESS&nbsp;TO&nbsp;LAUNCHES oF&nbsp;OTHER&nbsp;PROJECTS. Our team has DONE extensive research into the best INTEL and what makes MARKETS&nbsp;tick. Like everything else we are delivering with this project, we’re going to raise the bar.

THIS&nbsp;WILL ENSURE THAT THE QUALITY OF OUR WORK REMAINS HIGH AS WE GROW. THE ROLES WILL RANGE FROM PRODUCT MANAGERS, BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPERS TO 3D&nbsp;ANIMATORS, FASHION DESIGNERS and JOURNALISTS.

These beasthoods will act as your internal community within the AKCB ecosystem. There will be competitions, giveaways and opportunities rAn between beasthoods providing further benefits to holders who will compete with the other beasthoods for the added benefits. Beasthoods will have their own private chat to coordinate as well as an internal DAO Structure to manage leadership,&nbsp; beastlist charities, treasuries and more. We are excited to see which beasthoods will come to dominate the BLOCK. COMPLETE WE&nbsp;HAVE from OUR inception always been about creating a brand culture not limited by digital or physical limitations and by extension that includes the medium of music. Our team has multiple personal connections in the music and events industry and has thus built the project to include the key culture component of music into the brand. This can be demonstrated already by our custom AKCB promo scores, music competitions and radio. This is only going to only expand into the future as we discuss with artists the best way possible to synthesize music in a way which makes sense and will help establish a new music culture on web3. IN&nbsp;PROGRESS WITH THE ADDITION OF OUR OWN APPAREL, we will SEEK TO PARTNER WITH LIKE-MINDED BRANDS TO CREATE COLLOABORATION PIECES. UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOLDERS TO BE APART OF SPECIAL DROPS WITH OUR PARTNERED BRANDS. IN REALITY THAT MAY BE A&nbsp;DIGITAL, PHYSICAL OR BOTH. CONSIDER CERTAIN BRANDS RELEASEING ACCESSORIES FOR THEIR OWN BEASTS, or special mints that give access to unique one of a&nbsp;kind pieces of streetwear. Exploring As a brand focused on culture it is inevitable that we are to host events to galvanize our digital community in the physical world. Music shows, runways events, NFT conferences and parties are all included in our plans for this aspect of the project. Upon mint it is our intention to host multiple AKCB launch parties across the globe to celebrate the establishment of the neighborhood and the AKCB ecosystem. We’re already in talks with promoters and looking at venues for London and Miami and will have more details upon launch. Holders and their friends will be given priority access to these events but limited spaces will also be given to non-holder community members. ON&nbsp;GOING WE&nbsp;ARE a brand focused around the community and their own creative ideas and energy. As a result we want to empower our community Beasthoods via the usage of DAOs in order to govern themselves. Each Beasthood will have a DAO which will allow them to vote on key decisions such as electing representatives for the community, allocation of rewards from events and usage of the treasury and fund any internal projects that the DAO would wish to. This allows the Beasthoods to take on a&nbsp;truly unique personality independent of the main AKCB brand facilitating them to either thrive or dive depending on decisions made by the holder. With great power comes great responsibility.
