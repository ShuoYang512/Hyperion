Lock your tokens Authorize your wallet and head over to 'Passive Investment' in the dashboard. Set the amount and locking period; click submit and confirm transaction in your wallet. Release rewards It takes 48 hours for tokens to mature. After that, you can head over to transaction history in the dashboard and start releasing your rewards daily or upon the end of the locking period. Unlock your initial investment After the locking period has ended, head over to 'Transaction history' click 'Claim' and confirm the transaction in your wallet. After transaction confirmation, you will receive both your initial investment and staking rewards in case if anything is left unclaimed. #PIXBYStakingGame Coming soon.
