Maybe difficult if they change the memo format though. But worth to try, e.g., "estimated referral bonus" I initially thought there was a bug, one of my friend's result on my post in korean to introduce your bookkeeping :) https://steemit.com/kr/@blockchainstudio/bookkeeping#@bookkeeping/re-re-jaydih-re-blockchainstudio-bookkeeping-20190219t134006837z-20190219t134117z had zero sent for magicdice, but it was all referral. lol real winner :) $ 0 .10 Past Payouts $0.10, 0.25 TRX - Author $0.07, 0.18 TRX - Curators $0.02, 0.06 TRX Reply [-] holger80 ( 72 ) &nbsp; 5 years ago &nbsp; Good idea, I will look into it. $ 0 .00 Reply [-] jozef230 ( 70 ) &nbsp; 5 years ago &nbsp; Thanks!
