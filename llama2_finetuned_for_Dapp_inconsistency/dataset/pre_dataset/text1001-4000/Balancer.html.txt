This includes Aave launching their 80/20 AAVE/ETH Safety Incentive pool on Balancer and the recent Boosted Pool integration. The DAOs recently completed a token swap to further align the interests of both communities. “Part of what makes DeFi so exciting is its composability, and with Balancer this has resulted in a partnership that optimises the experience for liquidity providers through the use of Balancer Aave Boosted Pools and opens up new possibilities for Aave stakers with the AAVE/ETH Safety Incentive pool. We look forward to exploring more synergies with Balancer in the future.” Stani Kulechov Founder and CEO of Aave The most informed see the writing on the wall for how integral Balancer is becoming to DeFi liquidity.
