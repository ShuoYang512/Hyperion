I USED GPT-2 - A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM WHICH CAN BE USED FOR LANGUAGE TRAINING TO GENERATE TEXT, THAT I TRAINED WITH THOUSANDS OF PUNK AND EMO SONG LYRICS. &gt; THEY ALSO HAVE SUM RANDOMLY ASSIGNED BASTARDNESS ATTRIBUTES. SOME OF THEM ARE VEEEEEEEEERY RAAAAAAAAAARE &gt; HELP THESE BASTARDS FIND A NEW HOME ❤️. ADOPT THEM BEFORE THEY ALL RUN OUT! 👊👊👊👊👊 &gt; THIS PROJECT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH LARVA LABS . THANKS TO THEM FOR BEING SUCH AN INSPIRATION TO MANY OF US ❤️. THIS PROJECT IS A HOMAGE TO CRYPTOPUNKS AND A HYPOTHESIS ON HOW BASTARD CHILDREN CAN BE WAY COOLER THAN THEIR BOOMER ANCESTORS. &gt; ALSO A SHOUTOUT TO UNOFFICIAL PUNKS . TO BE HONEST, BASTARDS NEVER THOUGHT OF BEING A PART OF A COLLECTIVE, BECAUSE THEY ARE FREE SPIRITS, AND THEY KINDA WOULDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED "UNOFFICIAL" (EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE TECHNICALLY UNOFFICIAL LOL), BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THIS ADJECTIVE DEFINES THEM AS "THE BASTARDS THAT ARE DISOWNED BY THEIR PARENTS", EVEN THOUGH THEY CARRY REAL DEAL CRYPTOPUNK DNA IN THEIR BLOOD. THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHO THEIR EXACT PARENTS ARE. HOWEVER, THEY RECENTLY RECEIVED A MESSAGE SAYING THAT THEY ARE NOW A PART OF UNOFFICIAL PUNKS. WELL, BEING A STUBBORN BASTARD WON'T HELP ANYONE, SO THEY ARE GLADLY ACCEPTING THIS CALL LOL KUDOS TO ALL CREATIVES IN UNOFFICIAL PUNKS FOR BEING AWESOME! MAYBE BASTARD GAN PUNKS V3 WILL CARRY THEIR GENES THE NEXT TIME! - MINI BASTARD GALLERY - ABOUT ----------------------------------------------- BASTARD GAN PUNKS project has started as a hobby NFT project of me ( @berkozdemir ). There were two main reasons for me to initiate this project: - to practice Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with my own dataset, as part of my artistic research at Masters programme at ArtScience Interfaculty - even though Cryptopunks were way cheaper last year than now, I had no money to buy any, so I challenged myself to make "interesting enough" remixes of them. So I came up with the bastards concept. Bastard GAN Punks carry the genes of original Cryptopunk, but they carry many different traits from several punks, so they don't know who their actual parents are. And you know, sometimes BASTARDS are much cooler than their parents. Look at Jon Snow for example lol ----------------------------------------------- First iteration of Bastard Gan Punks were trained on 10000 original Cryptopunks and gave birth to many weirdo adorable motherfuckin' bastards. The process worked very well and I was so happy with getting weird interesting results. However, since some traits of Cryptopunks exist on just a few ones (like Alien, Ape, Zombie, or Beanie etc); most of the rare traits were lost during the model training. ----------------------------------------------- View more about the VERSION 1 BASTARDS on: Website - http://bganpunks.eth.link Opensea Rarible Etherscan Your browser does not support the video tag. DIFFERENCE OF BGANPUNKS V2 ----------------------------------------------- &gt; For BGANPUNKS V2, I chopped all Cryptopunks attributes, made cross-gender copies of ones which were made for only one gender (BGANPUNKS ARE QUEER!), categorised them in different folders (Hairs/Heads, Eyes, Glasses, Smokes etc.), and wrote a script to make all possible combinations of those traits. I also added skin and accessory color randomization + a couple of custom traits I've drawn myself. To be honest it was a painful and shitty process because I had to do all the cuts by hand and had to optimize the script via trial and error maybe like hundreds of times, to not to make unnecessary 1000000 images at the end which would take a lifetime to train the model with my shitty GPU. &gt; Also for each BASTARD V2 to have their own story like fortune cookie, I fetched all Punk &amp; Emo song lyrics from this website and trained them with GPT-2, which resulted in very weird texts which you will see in NFT description. In BGANPUNKS V1, there were lots of people who loved my humorous approach to NFT descriptions (I was writing goofy and edgy stuff), this time I trusted GPUs on this task. &gt; Disclaimer: I haven't been in process of selecting the texts and generating them. So if you encounter a text that is saying very very bad things (like hardcore racism, discrimination on an identity, promoting violence etc), tell me and I am gonna replace them with another freshly generated text. For instance, when I was checking some of the texts generated, I found out that some of them contained Nazi flattery (WTF???). I have no idea how it happened. So I had to find each of them and replace the word nazi with something else. I wonder if you will be able to find the ones i changed haha &gt; Yeah, I put a button below. When you click on it, one of the BASTARD fortune cookie will be revealed randomly. Each text you will see here will be in one of bastards' metadata description. CLICK THIS BUTTON TO VIEW A RANDOM LYRICS FROM MINTED BASTARDS NFT OWNERSHIP &amp;&amp; DERIVATIVE WORKS (APPLIES FOR BOTH V1 &amp;&amp; V2 BASTARDS) ----------------------------------------------- DERIVATIVE $HIT: BASTARD GAN PUNKS IS A REMIX/SPINOFF PROJECT OF LARVA LABS' CRYPTOPUNKS.

SO AS THE MAKER OF THIS PROJECT, I ENCOURAGE CREATIVE PEOPLE TO MAKE DERIVATIVE REMIX WORKS OF BASTARD GAN PUNKS, AS LONG AS THEY BRING THEIR NEW UNIQUE IDEAS, CONCEPTS AND AESTHETICS ON TOP OF IT.
