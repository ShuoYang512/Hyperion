You can buy any Metakey Edition on secondaries via our official collections on OpenSea or Rarible. What is the difference between each Edition? Every Edition offers the same core functionality. Distinct Editions offer cosmetic variations on various integrations and drops; a different level of scarcity; and occasional Edition-exclusive benefits offered by the Edition artist/s. What are the benefits of holding a Metakey? The Metakey is the NFT that keeps on giving. We are committed to packing each Edition with magnitudes of value beyond the original mint price. The benefits accumulate exponentially the longer you hold! What is the Metakrew? The Metakrew is our avatar collection— interoperable between multiple games and Metaverse spaces. The Metakrew is your identity in the Metaverse! When is the next Metakey Edition? The next Metakey Edition will not be released before the value of the current Edition is solidified, nor before demand has organically reached the point that the current Edition is no longer accessible to new users.
