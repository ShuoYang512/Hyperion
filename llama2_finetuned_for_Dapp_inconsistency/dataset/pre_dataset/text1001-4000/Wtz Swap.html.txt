 Connect Wallet Swap Meet WTZ, an FA2 token fully collateralized by XTZ, fully fungible, and oh so rewarding. DeFi, get ready. WTZ is fully fungible. Unlike other collateralized/wrapped XTZ, a user does not have a personal oven or vault. Anyone who holds WTZ can swap it back to XTZ at the current swap ratio. There is no slippage or loss of funds as there might be with trading through a DEX or AMM. There is now an FA2 compatible version of XTZ, ready for use in dapps and protocols across the ecosystem.
