 ThunderFaucet Welcome to THUNDER FAUCET , the DApp of NFT faucets. What are NFTs? A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique cryptographic object that exists on a blockchain. NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. They extract value from the uniqueness of the data added to each NFT and the fact that they are not fungible. Non-fungible means that they are not mutually exchangeable and that they typically cannot be broken down into smaller pieces such as cryptocurrencies. This further solidifies its value. What are Faucets? A faucet is an application or a website that distributes small amounts of cryptography for doing small tasks, for promoting cryptography or simply to know how a system works on the blockchain. They are given the name "taps" because the amounts are small, like tiny droplets of water dripping from a dripping faucet.
