Wrapped keys arrived soon after with some of the biggest FT acccounts adopting the mintable/burnable fractionalised ERC20 form. As TVL soars &amp; attention continues to be steadily focussed on FT a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem will require deep ERC20 liquidity for wrapped keys. Many communities have formed to share FT alpha and aggregate/mirror their favorite creators rooms. Many are also sharing the airdrop with their keyholders and the 33 dynamics based on points analysis. The idea of FT 33 is to combine these metas into a DAO format backing a deeply liquid reserve currency with Friend Tech assets including keys, wrapped keys, ecosystem related project tokens &amp; finally the airdropped token itself.Thus, the FT33 was born.NaN%Current APYHow does it work?The FT33 DAO takes ETH &amp; USDC and FT related assets into its treasury via two main mechanisms:the FT33 ft keys trading fees &amp; bonding.Excess ETH, beyond the 1-1 backing,is used to mint additional FTW which is given to the stakersA percentage of treasury assets are deployed to purchase strategic keys, wrapped keys &amp; FT ecosystem assets.
