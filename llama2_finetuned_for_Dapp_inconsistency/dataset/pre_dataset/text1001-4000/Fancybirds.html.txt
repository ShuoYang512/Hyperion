Fancy Birds is the first game created by Fancy Studios, with many more games already in development. Fancy Birds consist of 8,888 randomly generated birds with different features! Racing to earn their spot and claim the Treehouse Trophy, each bird will fight and race to earn their spot as the fanciest bird in the nest. Do you have what it takes? What is needed to play? You can play Fancy Birds for free! However, if you wish to enjoy more benefits in-game, you will need one bird (either a genesis bird or baby bird). Bird owners will be able to complete quests, compete on leaderboards, battle it out in tournaments, and earn $FNC in-game! Bot disclaimer Games and tournaments must be played directly by humans. The use of bots, ML, AI, pets, extra terrestrials or other means will get your bird banned permanently from breeding and playing.
