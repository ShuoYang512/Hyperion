Utilizing sophisticated risk management systems combined with complex farming strategies, and featuring partial liquidations, Leech saves users time and provides them with optimal returns. Leech constantly searches for the most profitable strategies Here you can see a backtest from Aug 1, 2022 to Jan 6, 2023, using the USDC/OP pool on Velodrome. We started with $100,000 and compounded daily. The average APR during this time was 50.49%, according to Beefy historical data. As you can see, using our hedging strategy resulted in a 19.06% portfolio value increase (48.06% annualized), vs a 0.66% increase (1.58% annualized) by providing liquidity to the pool, and a 17.6% decrease by holding 50% USDC and 50% OP. The strategy rebalanced 50 times, costing $1,010 and resulting in a net gain of just over $18K, or 18%, in just over 5 months.

All the user needs to do is select their level of risk. Lending protocol with partial liquidations In the classic lending protocol, when a user is liquidated, all of their collateralized assets are liquidated. With Leech Protocol, users are able to sell only part of the asset, allowing them to cover the drawdown and avoid a total liquidation and retain some of their assets.
