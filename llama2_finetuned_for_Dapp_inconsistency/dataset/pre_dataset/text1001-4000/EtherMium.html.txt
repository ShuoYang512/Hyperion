Binance, Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, etc are some of the crypto exchanges available and all of them allow Ethereum trading. Trading bots like Bitcoin 360 AI also allow users to trade top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. You must be very careful while choosing the type of crypto exchange. There are fiat exchanges and C2C exchanges. Fiat exchanges are the ideal choice to trade Ethereum. C2C is the best option to trade multiple cryptocurrencies or to convert other crypto tokens to Ethereum. Create your account on an exchange After choosing the crypto exchange, the next step is to create your account. The process resembles creating an account on a brokerage platform. You have to provide your details including your name, social security number, address, identification forms, etc. Most exchanges ask you to verify your account in multiple ways to ensure your identity. You need to upload your documents in this step for verification and make sure that your account follows the regulatory standards. Deposit fiat currencies The next step is to deposit fiat currencies in your account. Fiat currency exchanges will have a verification process, after which it is easy to deposit. You can transfer money from your debit card or bank account. It is a bit difficult to deposit money in a C2C account. You will have to send cryptocurrency through code. Most exchanges allow Ethereum as a depositing currency. Start trading If your account is verified and you have money in your account, you can trade Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies through the exchange. The interface of each crypto exchange will be operating differently. After confirming the transactions, wait for the processing time. The processing time also depends on the total transactions the user has requested. Use a wallet to withdraw Ethereum After buying Ethereum through the exchange you have chosen, that currency can be withdrawn into your wallet or bank account. Withdrawing ETH is comparatively easy in fiat exchanges. You just have to sell ETH and then send the profits to your bank account. It takes a longer time in C2C exchanges. You will have to transfer your ETH as a code to the fiat exchange, after which the sale and cash-out process happen. All the platforms allow you to send the ETH to your wallet.
