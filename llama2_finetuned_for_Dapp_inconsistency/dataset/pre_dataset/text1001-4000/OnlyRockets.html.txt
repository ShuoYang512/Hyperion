 The first NFT game about space capitalism Play &amp; Earn Tokens Rockets Levels Roadmap Modifiers Tokenised Economy The game takes place in space filled with resources to mine. There are 4 types of resources in the game: Metal, Crystals, Energy and Data. Each of them can be exchanged for another. To get resources, you need to build and launch a certain type of rocket. Players controls MarketS Players can choose their development strategy: either mining a certain resource and improving their rockets as quickly as possible or developing several areas at the same time, creating a more powerful production. This will ensure independence and security from market fluctuations. Metal ORM on Alcor Metal is a material crucial for building new rockets. Cargo rockets mine Metal. You can get it from a resource pack. Crystals ORC On Alcor Without crystals, we won't be able to make an alloy for new rockets. This resource is mined by the Harvester rockets. You can get it from a resource pack. Energy ORE On Alcor Energy is needed so rockets can fly to get other resources. Building a new rocket also requires Energy. Explorer Rockets mine energy. Data ORD On Alcor Data is needed so that the rockets can mine other resources. Data is also needed to build a new rocket. This resource is mined by Scout rockets. Exclusive NFTs You will need at least one NFT to play! You can buy any of the NFTs available on the market or get them from the packs. As you can see from the illustrations, there are four rocket types to choose from: CARGO, SCOUT, EXPLORER and HARVESTER. Multilevel System Players will be able to enhance their rockets through the smart blending system. The illustration below shows images of NFT OnlyRockets that will be used for resource mining. Modifiers Modifiers could make the rocket more productive and give the player an edge without blending So how it works in brief: for example, Engine V5 increases energy productivity and reduces energy consumption. If you use this modifier with Explorer Rocket it gives you 25% energy mining boost. If you use Engine V5 with Scout Rocket you will get 25% energy consumption cut down. Timeburner is the modifier that pumps mining time. For example, usually mining time after rocket launch takes 6 hours but if you will use Timeburner Common modifiers it will take 8 hours.
