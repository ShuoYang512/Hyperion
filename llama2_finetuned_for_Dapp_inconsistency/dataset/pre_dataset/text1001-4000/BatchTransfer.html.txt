What can BatchTransfer do?BatchTransfer is a Dapp that enables users to batch transfer NFTs, airdrop tokens or ETH safely and efficiently to one or multiple wallets in a single transaction and save 40%-70% of the transaction fee (gas). You can use this Dapp to transfer NFTs between your wallets, send ETH to hundreds of wallets to participate in raffles of NFT projects, and airdrop your ETH or ERC20 tokens to as many wallets as you want.2. Why is BatchTransfer safe to use?BatchTransfer does not have access to your private key, recovery phase or wallet password. All the transactions can only be initiated by your wallet.3. What is one-time Approve? Why is Approve safe?The one-time Approve means that you allow the BatchTransfer contract to transfer your tokens to the wallet addresses you input. You will be asked to Approve only once for each token contract. After Approve, the actual transaction can only be initiated by your wallet. BatchTransfer does not have access to your assets.4. How to use BatchTransfer?There are 3 steps. First, Input token and receivers information. Second, Approve BatchTransfer to transfer your tokens. You’ll be asked to do so only once for each token contract. Finally, Safe Batch Transfer your tokens and save transaction fee. Please refer to our tutorial for more details.5. What if the token I want to transfer does not show up in the drop-down list?We use paid API to check the tokens in your wallet, which may take a few seconds. You will find your tokens in the drop-down list most of the time. In rare cases when you cannot find your token in the drop-down list, you can insert the token contract address manually. You will receive an error message if the token contract address you inserted cannot be found in your wallet.6. What is the maximum number of rows I can transfer in a single transaction?We have a limit on the number of rows for each transaction to make sure that the transaction goes through successfully. The limits are different for different token standards and chains, depending on their gas usage and block sizes. The maximum numbers of rows in a single transaction are as follows. Ethereum: ETH (600), ERC-20 (500), ERC-721 (300), ERC-1155 (600); BSC: BNB (1000), BEP-20 (600), BEP-721 (600), BEP-1155 (1000); Polygon: MATIC (600), ERC-20 (600), ERC-721 (300), ERC-1155 (600); Avalanche: AVAX (240), ERC-20 (240), ERC-721 (240), ERC-1155 (150); Fantom: FTM (600), ERC-20 (600), ERC-721 (240), ERC-1155 (400); Heco: HT (800), HRC-20 (800), HRC-721 (400), HRC-1155 (800); Moonbeam: GLMR (300), ERC-20 (300), ERC-721 (150), ERC-1155 (300); Moonriver: MOVR (300), ERC-20 (300), ERC-721 (150), ERC-1155 (300). When the number of rows exceeds the limit, you can divide your input into multiple chunks, and transfer one chunk at a transaction. The divide-and-transfer process guarantees your security and transaction success.7. How much transaction fee (gas) can BatchTransfer save?It depends on how many receivers or NFTs you have. For a typical case of 10 receivers or 10 NFTs, you can save 40% of the transaction fee (gas). The more receivers or NFTs you have, the more transaction fee (gas) will be saved.8. How much commission does BatchTransfer charge?Commission is free for Solana, Polygon, HECO chain, Klaytn, Aurora, Fusion, Moonbeam, and Moonriver. For Ethereum Mainnet, commission is free if you have only one row of input. For inputs that have more than one rows, we have a minimum commission of 0.0025 ETH. The more rows you have, the less commission per row. We also have a maximum commission limit. The commission is usually much less than the transaction fee (gas) you save. You will see the commission before you confirm the transaction in your wallet. Please check the pricing plan section for our current pricing policy.9. How to generate the referral link?Please go to the referral section, input your wallet address, and click the generate button. You can copy your referral link and share it with friends. We will encode your wallet address to protect your privacy.10. How does the referral bonus work?After your friends use BatchTransfer from your referral link for the first time, you will get 20% of the commission and your friends will get 10% discount of the commission every time they use BatchTransfer. Once referred, you and your friends will continue to get the referral bonus even without using your referral link again. Your friends’ discounts are applied directly when they use BatchTransfer. Your referral bonus will be paid at the end of each month if the accumulated referral bonus is greater than 0.01 ETH. You can check your current accumulated referral bonus at BatchTransfer.app.11. What is the difference between ERC-721 and ERC-1155? How do I know whether my NFTs are ERC-721 or ERC-1155?ERC-721 is the most widely used non-fungible token (NFT). It is immutable, transparent in ownership and security. Hence it is non-fungible, a true NFT. It cannot be divided and represents a single asset. It is great for creating and tracking unique NFTs. ERC-1155 is a unique token that supports both non-fungible and fungible tokens. It is faster and more efficient to use in batch token transfers. ERC-1155 can use a single contract to make various types of NFTs to save gas, but the ERC-1155 is harder to track in terms of ownership. You can find the token standard in the Details section of each NFT’s page at OpenSea.io.12. How to find the Token ID of my NFT?You can click the (?) button above the receiver and Token_ID input textarea. It will show you three steps: First, go to the OpenSea NFT web page. Then, scroll down, and expand the Details. Finally, click the Token ID to copy it.13. Can I use BatchTransfer on Ethereum Testnets?Definitely. We encourage you to test BatchTransfer on Ethereum Testnets including Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby, and Goerli.14. What if my transaction takes longer than usual?This could happen when the Ethereum gas price has a sudden surge. You may want to view the transaction on EtherScan.io to make sure the transaction is on-chain. If your transaction has been pending for longer than usual, you can increase the Max fee (GWEI) in your wallet. To do so in your MetaMask wallet, you can go to the Activity tab to find you pending transaction, and click Speed up and edit the Max fee (GWEI) to what the MetaMask suggests or even higher.
