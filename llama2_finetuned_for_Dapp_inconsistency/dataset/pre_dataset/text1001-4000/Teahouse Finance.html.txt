They run dedicated DeFi strategies that dynamically respond to market signals and are managed by professional Strategy Managers.ACTIVE VAULTSMY POOLSFAQsWhat are Teahouse Managed Vaults?Teahouse Managed Vaults are similar to traditional funds. Users deposit their single-type assets into select strategies to be managed by Teahouse or a Teahouse strategy partner, and can enter/exit the vaults every Round (all Rounds are currently on a weekly basis).Strategies run offline for privacy and efficiency reasons, but all funds are stored and managed transparently on-chain. They are categorized into Low, Medium, and High-Risk categories based on their backtested Maximum Drawdown.What are Teahouse Permissionless Vaults?Teahouse Permissionless Vaults are dual-asset token pairs used to provide liquidity. Users deposit two types of tokens into select strategies to be managed by Teahouse or a Teahouse strategy partner, and can enter and exit at any point in time. Strategies run offline for privacy and efficiency reasons, but all funds are stored and managed transparently on-chain.What are the difference between Managed and Permissionless Vaults?Users should generally look at each of the underlying strategy concept, mechanism, and historical data rather than the vault type, then pick the one(s) most suitable to individual needs.From the users' point of view, Permissionless Vaults may be more convenient, as one can enter &amp; exit at any time. However, these will require two types of assets to be deposited.What are the requirements for participation?Currently, vaults on the Ethereum mainnet are NFT-gated (must hold HighTable NFT to access), and vaults on the Layer 2 chains are available to anyone as a beta offering. Note that in general, NFT-gated vaults also assess a lower fee as a benefit to our holders. (Please check the individual strategy pages for actual fee values.)How do I pick a strategy?Teahouse recommends users to select strategies based on their understanding of the current market and their own risk-tolerance. Some types of strategy tend to perform better than others in certain conditions.In addition, our Managed Vaults are labeled with their respective back-tested "maximum drawdown" values to indicate their risk level. It may also be beneficial to diversify into more than one strategy.How do I use the Managed Vaults?A user may DEPOSIT AssetTokens (e.g. ETH or USDC) into a Managed Vault and get back an equal value (based on current price) of ShareTokens as proof of ownership. At the start of a round, the user's AssetTokens are locked into the vault, and the ShareTokens can be manually claimed to the user's wallet. When the user wants to cash out, the user can REDEEM their ShareTokens back into AssetTokens and then WITHDRAW.Additional information can be found in our walkthrough guidesHow do I use the Permissionless Vaults?A user may DEPOSIT a pair of AssetTokens (e.g. ETH &amp; USDC) into a Permissionless Vault to provide liquidity. User will receive an equal value (based on current price) of ShareTokens as proof of ownership at the time of DEPOSIT, and can WITHDRAW (redeem ShareTokens back into AssetTokens) at any time.Additional information can be found in our walkthrough guides.What fees does Teahouse charge?Teahouse charges entry/exit fees, management fees, and performance fees.The fee structure may vary between strategies.
