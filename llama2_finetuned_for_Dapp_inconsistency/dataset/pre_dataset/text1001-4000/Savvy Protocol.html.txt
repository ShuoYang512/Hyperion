Frequently Asked Questions Quick Questions We are here to help you. Reach out on Discord , Telegram , or Twitter. What is Savvy? A synthetic credit protocol that enables you to access non-liquidating, auto-repaying lines of credit. How is the borrowed line of credit non-liquidating? Collateral and credit lines are denominated in the same unit of account (ETH mints svETH). The loan always stays overcollateralized regardless of market volatility. How is the borrowed line of credit auto-repaying? Borrowers' deposit into yield-bearing strategies that are integrated with Savvy. The yield generated by these strategies is attributed to the balance of the loan, effectively repaying the loan over time. Which crypto assets can I borrow against? We accept stablecoins (DAI/USDT/USDC), ETH, BTC, and some LSDs as collateral.&nbsp; What is SVY? As a vital component of the ecosystem, SVY enables DAO membership and unlocks access to the protocol's smart contracts. SVY also serves as a potent dual incentive for liquidity providers and borrowers, fueling the growth of the platform. How do the synthetic tokens maintain their peg? Synthetic tokens maintain their peg through three mechanisms: 1. Savvy Swap - Exchange svTokens for base tokens at a guaranteed but non-instantaneous 1-to-1 redemption. 2. Algorithmic Market Operation - Protocol owned liquidity used to automatically balance liquidity pools. 3. SVY incentives - SVY incentives encourage liquidity provision to certain pools. What happens when the collateral loses dollar value? Since the collateral and credit line are denominated in the same unit of account, the credit line is unaffected by dollar value variability. Is Savvy audited? Yes, Savvy is audited by Halborn. Want alpha? Follow our socials and join our community for the latest announcements and features. All Rights Reserved. © 2023 Savvy DeFi.
