The best place to buy Axion is on our Auction platform , where you can get an automatic 10% discount compared to buying on the market. Once the daily auction ends, you can stake your AXN to get all the benefits of our incredible ecosystem. AXN is also available on Uniswap if you’d like to buy on the exchange.

To interact with the Axion ecosystem (and the cryptocurrency world at large) you’ll need an Ethereum wallet. We recommend MetaMask but support others too. When you create a wallet, it will generate a unique seed phrase (which you should never take a picture of on your phone or share with anyone, ever!) and a public wallet address. This public address is what you will use to buy, sell, stake, and unstake your Axion investment. For more information on setting up a MetaMask wallet, visit our knowledgebase article here: https://support.axion.network/en/articles/5033985-tutorial-setting-up-metamask Or for a list of all the supported wallets: https://support.axion.network/en/articles/5253370-which-wallets-can-i-use-with-axion Is Axion available on a major cryptocurrency exchange? Currently, Axion is available via our platform and on ApeSwap via the official Axion contract . Future exchange listings will be announced as Axion grows! For more information, visit our Knowledge Base article here: https://support.axion.network/en/articles/5039090-does-axion-plan-to-be-listed-on-any-major-exchanges What does ‘staking’ mean? Staking is the process by which you lock your investment away for a period of time and earn interest paid in AXN. Similar to a Certificate of Deposit account at a traditional bank, your investment is secured within the Axion Smart Contract, where you exchange your AXN for Shares. The longer the term of your investment, the greater the number of shares you will receive, summarized simply as Longer Pays Better. You can stake your AXN from a minimum of 1 day up to 5555 days (or 15.22 years!). When your AXN is staked, you are actively earning interest and liquid Bitcoin rewards. When the term of your stake ends, you can withdraw your staked AXN. For more information about staking, visit our Knowledge Base article here: https://support.axion.network/staking/staking-portal How long should I stake? The term length for your stake determines the amount of shares that you will receive off your investment. How long you want to stake is just as important as how much you want to stake. Axion’s token ‘Max Shares’ stakes are 15.22 years (or 5555 days) long, and they provide a massive bonus in the shares you will receive. Of course, this means your investment is locked away for 15 years. But thanks to the Venture Capital Auctions (VCAs) you will receive liquid bitcoin rewards proportional to your shares so you can earn passive income while your principal investment grows. With the calculator available at https://calc.axion.network you can easily estimate the potential growth and returns of your investment, keeping in mind that the calculator does not provide guaranteed results. For more information about how to use the calculator, visit our Knowledge Base article here: https://support.axion.network/staking/staking-portal/estimate-your-staking-returns Can I access or spend my AXN when it is staked? When you stake your AXN, you are effectively removing the AXN from circulation and replacing it with Shares that are proportional to your investment (based on amount and length of your stake). Thus, there is no AXN for you to access or spend. If you want to keep your AXN spendable (this is commonly referred to as ‘liquid AXN’) then you should not stake, or you should only stake part of your available AXN. Keep in mind that any unstaked AXN does not get to participate in what makes Axion great, such as its DAO voting system, Bitcoin rewards, 8% APY growth in AXN, Axion Launches, etc. Staked Axion is Axion that is growing! To get started with Staking, be sure to check out our Knowledge Base article: https://support.axion.network/staking/staking-portal/create-a-new-stake What if I want to withdraw my stake early? In order to protect the integrity of the overall Axion ecosystem, all early withdrawals are subject to a penalty proportionate to the completed term. This penalty incentivizes all stakers to keep their Axion secure for the duration of the term, providing stability to the ecosystem. If you are 35% of the way through your term, then you would only get 35% of your AXN (principal + interest) back, with 65% of your AXN penalized. All penalized AXN is sent to the next daily auction to be bought by bidders. For more information about early withdrawals, check out our Knowledge base article: https://support.axion.network/staking/staking-portal/early-unstakes What are the Auctions? Although the word auction may sound like something that you would expect to find at a bidding site, they are merely the way that Axion maintains and grows its ecosystem. When an investor bids into the Auction, they are able to acquire AXN at a discounted rate when compared to buying at the market rate (via SushiSwap). Currently, when you buy in the Auction you get a % more AXN, and during special events, these bonuses can increase significantly. Depending on the auction, a percentage of the proceeds of the auction go to paying Axion shareholders in AXN or wBTC rewards, respectively. This is what provides growth for all shareholders. There are two types: Regular and Venture Capital. To learn more about these auctions and the differences, click here: https://support.axion.network/en/articles/5031692-what-are-the-auctions What is the ‘Regular’ Auction? On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays we hold our regular auctions. In each, there are currently 200,000,000 (200m) AXN available for sale. People bid Ethereum (ETH) into the auction to win a share of AXN at a discounted rate compared to buying on the market (Uniswap). These auctions also buy back AXN from the market, which is distributed to our stakers as dividends. Read More about the Regular auction What is the ‘Venture Capital’ Auction? Venture Capital Auctions are the mechanism by which liquid bitcoin dividends are possible. On Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays we hold a VCA. In each auction, there are currently 500,000,000 (500m) AXN available for sale. People bid Ethereum (ETH) into the auction to win a share of AXN at a discounted rate compared to buying on the market (Uniswap). These auctions also buy wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) from the market, which is distributed to our stakers as VCA dividends. Read More about the Venture Capital auction Why does Axion vote? Axion is a community-driven project, which means that it places a huge emphasis on its shareholders as they are the foundation of Axion itself. Instead of letting an internal team decide on major decisions, the community can vote on the changes first. What sort of things does the Axion community vote on? The community will get the chance to vote on upcoming events, auction caps and distribution and changes to the team amongst other things. What is a DAO? DAO is an acronym of 'Decentralized Autonomous Organization'. This is a group of people or organizations that are unified in purpose such that they act as one organizational body. This DAO allows Axion shareholders a chance to vote on prominent changes to the Axion ecosystem. Are there any requirements to vote? Votes are weighted by the number of shares the user holds, and only stakes with durations longer than one year count. Learn more about the DAO Voting system here: https://support.axion.network/en/collections/2892965-dao-voting What is Discord? Discord is a free voice, video, and text chat app that's used by tens of millions of people to talk and hang out with their communities and friends. It’s the central hub of Axions’ community, where over 10,000 of our members are active. How can I join? You can join our ever-growing Discord community by clicking this link: https://discord.gg/axion Please note, our Discord may not be suitable for every investor, and we are not responsible for the content that our members post.
