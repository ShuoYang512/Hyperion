It is used to buy board coins, run ads or give awards to other users. You can earn MAIN tokens for your social activity, get from other users or from the sale of board coins, or just buy.Board coins â€“ are community tokens that are minted when purchased and burned when sold. The price of each coin goes up when people buy and goes down when people sell. Buy coins with MAIN tokens to own communities and get rewards. How does it works 1 Each community on MAIN has its own coins 2 People buy and sell community coins with MAIN tokens 3 The more coins people buy, the higher their price 4 Coins give users power and rewards 5 Community owners earn on the community growth Economics designed to scale 1. Growing difficulty Since the daily rewards are limited, it becomes more and more difficult to get new tokens as the number of users grows. 2. Limited emission Although it becomes more difficult to earn tokens over time, the value of each token increases, since their total supply is limited. 3. In-game utility Most of the tokens that people earn from their activity are locked back into board coins to get more rewards instead of being sold on the market. 4. Increasing demand Each new community, like each new user, needs MAIN tokens to buy board coins and join the game, which generates a constant demand for tokens. 5. Providing value Behind every board coin lies an entire community of real users who create content and provide value that can be monetized. 6. Hold to earn mechanics Board coins give people power and increase in value when other people buy them, so users tend to hold coins to benefit in the future.
