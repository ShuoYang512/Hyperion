Why choose Echooo? Echooo supports the most Blockchains and protocols, is the largest AA wallet for 2C users. AA wallets ensure higher security compared to traditional EOA wallets: EOAs associate the account with the private key, so if the private key is lost, the account is lost as well. In contrast, AA Wallets keep the account and the private key separate. While the private key is used to initiate transactions, the approval of transactions requires multisignature verification from AA. Even if the private key is lost, it can be recovered through social recovery, avoiding a single point of failure. AA wallets also have programmable features such as changing signature thresholds and setting trusted addresses, further enhancing security. But Echooo is not just a wallet. Echooo is a blockchain infrastructure designed around an Intent-centric approach, offering users a one-stop, intention-driven virtual asset management solution that perfectly balances asset security with liquidity.
