Liquid staking is a mechanism within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space that allows users to stake their cryptocurrency to earn rewards while retaining liquidity of the staked assets. Unlike traditional staking, where the staked funds are locked and inaccessible for a defined period, liquid staking provides a tokenized version of the staked assets. This means users can still buy, sell, trade, or use those assets, making them more flexible and convenient. Liquid staking offers the dual benefit of better rewards through staking and the ability to continue utilizing the staked funds in other DeFi opportunities. What are the benefits of liquid staking? Staking rewards: Liquid staking enables you to get auto-compounded rewards from staking your crypto tokens anytime. &nbsp; Enhanced liquidity: You can access staking rewards anytime by converting your tokens into liquid tokens, avoiding lock-up periods. You can freely trade or use these liquid tokens in DeFi protocols and unlock additional rewards on top of staking rewards. &nbsp; Liquid staking is a great option to enjoy flexibility and get staking rewards without locking up your tokens.
