"Using Request for crypto invoicing and integrated crypto payments feature has made my job so much easier! It also keeps all my invoices in one place instead of cluttering up my inbox. 100% recommended!" Emma Heard - Accountant Gnosis “Request Finance is incredibly simple to use. The extensive list of cryptocurrencies available as payment options, and being able to denominate crypto invoices in fiat prices based on prevailing exchange rates made bookkeeping a breeze.” Antoine Chaveron - CEO Unicrypt Network “Recurring payments are easier to keep track of all in one place. Request has also enabled us to easily export all our payments data for tax reporting purposes. We’ve probably saved 40-60 man hours just in the last six months of using it.” Robin Lehmann - CEO Data Union “Request Finance makes it easy for our accountants to manage our crypto payments, and simplifies payroll in crypto for our global team with thoughtful features like the ability to pay multiple crypto invoices at once, or schedule invoices.” Rudy Kadoch - CEO Nested Finance “The team at Fantom Foundation used to spend many hours a month just on managing and accounting for crypto payments. With Request, we now spend only far fewer hours processing almost US$100k in payments monthly, and we anticipate that this number will go up.” Michael Kong - CEO Fantom “Other solutions we saw didn't have all the functionalities we needed, like sending invoice requests, batch payments, and integration with multisig wallets like Gnosis. Only Request did.” Sébastien Borget - COO The Sandbox “We love using Request because it just makes the whole invoicing process more efficient for all the parties involved while ensuring the accounting compliance set by our auditors.” Daniel Lustig - COO Ocean Protocol “Thank you so much for your help, we have already had our contractors upload invoices and said how smooth the process was” Connie Smith - Assistant AAVE “Using Request for crypto invoicing and integrated crypto payments feature has made my job so much easier! It also keeps all my invoices in one place instead of cluttering up my inbox. 100% recommended!" Emma Heard - Finance Manager Gnosis “Request gave me structure. It gave me a workflow to manage supplier payments connected to the contacts of those suppliers along with their wallet addresses. It gave me confidence knowing that I would be sending funds to a supplier's wallet address they have entered directly into their invoice.” Ryan Kris - Founder/COO Verida Learn how to scale your crypto company's spending with our all-in-one account Your financial complexities are our specialties.
