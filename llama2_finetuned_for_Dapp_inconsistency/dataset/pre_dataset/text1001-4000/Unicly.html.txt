What does it do?Yes, there will be a token called UNIC! UNIC will be a governance token capped at 1M total supply, and the inflation rate will decrease approximately once a month. Unicly will be governed by UNIC token holders. You can farm UNIC by staking whitelisted LP tokens and/or staking UNIC to earn more UNIC.Who built Unicly?Me! I’m Leia, nice to meet you. I go by 0xLeia on most platforms. I build, design, and draw stuff :)How will UNIC be launched? Who are the investors?There are no investors. It will be a completely fair launch. I’ll start with 1 UNIC and whitelist some pools. At that point, anybody can provide liquidity and stake LP tokens to earn UNIC. UNIC will be minted to LP token stakers each block. You’ll be able to claim and stake your UNIC to earn even more UNIC. The first month will have the highest UNIC mint rate ever, so the earlier you participate, the better.What can you do on Unicly?You can find uToken collections on the Discover. If you find NFTs that you like, look through the collection and put up a bid! If you want a piece of the whole collection, you can buy some uTokens. As a uToken holder, you can govern the collection. If you believe that the total value of the bids on the collection is high enough for the collection, you should stake your uTokens to unlock the NFTs. Once enough people stake, you can redeem your uTokens for some of the NFT auction proceeds.How do you farm UNIC?If you have uTokens, it’s always good to provide liquidity, since you can stake your LP tokens to earn more UNIC. You can do this on the Farm page. You can also stake more UNIC to get xUNIC. xUNIC can be converted for more UNIC over time. Thanks 0xMaki and Chef Nomi!How do you create a uToken collection?If you are a creator, collector, and/or NFT enthusiast with a lot of amazing NFTs, you should make your own collection! You can do this by going to the uToken page, and creating a collection with your own settings and the NFTs of your choice. You can provide liquidity for the uTokens issued in order to distribute it to your audience. UNIC holders can vote to whitelist your collection if the community likes it.Join a unique community!Learn more about Unicly, read latest updates from the team, chat with other users, and vote for the future of Unicly.The protocol to combine, fractionalize, and trade NFTs.LightProductuTokenPoolSwapFarmVoteCommunityTelegramDiscordMediumTwitterGovernance ForumDevelopersGithubGenesis BlogSecurity AuditDocsTutorials© 2019 - 2021 Unic.ly - All rights reserved.
