Security Audits The Liqee lending markets codebase is based on codes from dForce lending. Ecosystem dForce advocates for building an integrated and interoperable DeFi protocol matrix, covering lending (global pool, yield markets), assets (multi-currency stablecoin, synths, etc), and trading (aggregator). StaFi is the first DeFi protocol unlocking liquidity of staked assets. Users can stake PoS tokens through StaFi and receive rTokens in return, which are available for trading while still earning staking rewards. Lido is a liquid staking solution for Ethereum.
