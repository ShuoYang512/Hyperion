Therefore, Web3ite Pass tries to integrate the consensus of traditional domain names in the off-chain world into Web3, such as using NFTs to assign ownership of domain names, and applying DNS domain names to the blockchain based on existing protocols and infrastructure. We give DNS domain names unprecedented value with the characteristics of blockchains. Easy to disseminate With the consensus that has developed with traditional DNS domains, the web3.com domains are memorable and easy to disseminate, perfect for Web3 explorers to use, and are a natural focus of the attention of the Web3 community.
