Unlike other breeding games, MicroBuddies reproduce asexually through a process known as replication. Replicating a MicroBuddy requires GOO and will create a new MicroBuddy of the next generation with traits inherited from its parent - the better the traits, the better the GOO production! Develop MicroBuddies with unique traits and trade them on the Ethereum blockchain via OpenSea. Buy a Buddy Game Docs FAQ Frequently Asked Questions What is MicroBuddies TM ? MicroBuddies is a new, collectible NFT breeding game created by the publicly traded company, Good Gaming! What is GOO TM ? GOO is an ERC-20 Fungible-Token on the Polygon blockchain that’s produced and held by MicroBuddies based on the production power of their dominant traits, rarity, generation, fertility, and the global “peg” value, which is a soft cap on the supply of GOO designed to control for inflation and keep GOO valuable. GOO can be spent in the MicroBuddies game world to replicate other MicroBuddies and improve their traits in future generations. Most of the GOO spent in-game is permanently burnt from the supply.
