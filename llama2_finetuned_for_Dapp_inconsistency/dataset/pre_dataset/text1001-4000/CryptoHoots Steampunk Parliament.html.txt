Hooting Sep 28, 2021! 2,500 Limited Run Steampunk Owl NFTs Millions of Combinations Verifiably Random Generated Exclusive Access To NFT Builder Software Join the Parliament ! About CryptoHoots are a rowdy crowd of steampunk owls who think the 20th century was a mistake. They live in an alternate timeline in the metaverse where gear-driven gadgets and steam-powered machinery rules the roost. They have no need for electricity. Their blockchain technology uses *actual* chains and blocks. These fascinating creatures must be studied! We need your help to catalog 2,500 Hoots from this timeline. Identifying Hoots Though birds of a feather they be, each one has a verifiably unique personality. Four primary breeds exist in the wild, but if you're lucky enough, you'll catch a glimpse of a rare, mechanical Hootoid. There have been rumors of undead, featherless hoots as well, but no one's lived to tell. In the Field Each bird has up to 12 unique traits. While some Hoots prefer to lounge about, naked as a jaybird, others have a bit more, ahem, sophistication. An expansive collection of steampunk attire have been spotted in the wild. Try to collect samples of the rarest combinations. What You Need You'll need MetaMask or a WalletConnect-enabled Ethereum wallet with some ETH.
