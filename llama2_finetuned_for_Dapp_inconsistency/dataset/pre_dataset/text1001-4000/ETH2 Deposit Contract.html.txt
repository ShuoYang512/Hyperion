Validators are key to the more secure, scalable, and sustainable Ethereum we're building together.More on the Ethereum visionBy running a validator, you'll be responsible for securing the network and receive continuous payouts for actions that help the network reach consensus.Since the successful transition to proof-of-stake via The Merge, Ethereum is fully secured by proof-of-stake validators. By running a validator, you'll be helping to secure the Ethereum network.More on the Beacon ChainMore on the MergeValidating in Ethereum is not the same as mining. The outcomes are similar: the work you do will extend and secure the chain. But the process is completely different because they use different consensus mechanisms.More on consensus mechanismsBecome a validatorBecoming a validator is a big responsibility with important preparation steps. Only start the deposit process when you're ready.üìö1. Learn about your responsibilitiesThe Ethereum upgrades will only be successful if validators understand the risks and responsibilities.Validators FAQüîß2. Prep nodesYou'll need to run an execution client (formerly 'Eth1') as well as a consensus client (formerly 'Eth2') to become a validator. Take a look at the checklist to prepare yourself and your equipment.Hardware checklistü•ã3.

These upgrades will improve Ethereum while seamlessly continuing on the chain of today. Here's more on the different upgrades:Proof-of-stake and the Beacon ChainEthereum is secured by proof-of-stake, although this was not always the case. The Beacon Chain was the first step to establishing a PoS consensus layer on Ethereum, launching in parallel to Mainnet in December 2020. This allowed participants to start staking their ETH and prepare the network for the formal transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake via The Merge.More on the Beacon ChainThe MergeThe Merge upgrade officially brought proof-of-stake to Ethereum on September 15, 2022, simultaneously deprecating proof-of-work. This prepared the chain for future scaling upgrades such as Danksharding by bringing proof-of-stake consensus together with Mainnet, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by over 99.9%.This marked the merging of the execution layer (existing Mainnet) with the new consensus layer (the Beacon Chain) to form the single Ethereum chain of today.More on the MergeShardingDanksharding will change the requirement that full nodes carry the entire history of the chain, and instead will distribute this load amongst the network while still ensuring data availability. This will significantly expand the capacity of layer 1 Ethereum while maintaining the ability to operate a full node on consumer hardware, keeping the network decentralized.More on DankshardingThe upgradesDig deeper into the Ethereum roadmap.How does this all happen?Deposit contract formally verifiedThe deposit contract has been verified at a byte-code level to ensure your safety.Formal verification reportValidators FAQLearn more about the roles and responsibilities of Ethereum validators.More on validatorsStaking LaunchpadDepositChecklistFAQTerms of ServiceBecome a validator ü¶èMore on stakingThe Ethereum roadmapAvoid phishingStaking economicsFormal verification report
