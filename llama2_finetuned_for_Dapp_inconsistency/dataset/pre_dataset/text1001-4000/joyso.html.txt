ETH can be exchanged for any ERC-20 Tokens supported by the Website (collectively “Token”) and vice versa via smart contracts provided by the Website. For exchanging Tokens, You need to first deposit Tokens into the smart contract through Metamask or other Ethereum Wallets supported by the Website. Then submit buy or sell orders to the Website, where the buy-orders and sell-orders will be automatically matched. When a match is found, the smart contract verifies your signature and publishes the result of such transaction on the Website. Your transaction will be processed and settled on the Blockchain. The exchange rate and quantity of Tokens are defined by the two parties participating in such transaction. The Website does not allow You to exchange Tokens for anything other than another kind of Token, including but not limited to any fiat currencies or other consideration in any form.TRANSACTION FEES AND AUTHORIZATIONCompany charges transaction fees from both parties involved in the transaction of Tokens, including the party who places a limited order on the order book on Website (“Maker”) and the party who places an order which is matched immediately (“Taker”). Both Maker and Taker may be either buyer or seller of Tokens. The whole amount of Transaction Fees collected by Company will include the Trading Fee paid to Company and the Gas Fee collected by Company and paid to miners. When a Maker or a Taker signs the order, the Trading Fee and Gas fee will also be included in the order, in which the exchange rate between JOY and ETH is recorded at the time of signature. Future fluctuation in exchange rate will not affect the order in regards to trading fees. The Company will charge 0.1% of the Tokens traded against Maker and 0.2% of the Tokens traded against Taker as Trading Fee. A Maker or Taker may select to pay Trading Fee in JOY Tokens and will be entitled to have a 50% discount of such Trading Fee. Exchange rate for JOY/ETH will be calculated as “the average exchange rate over the past hour on the exchange.Both Maker and Taker will be charged the Gas Fee, which is an one-time payment for each order which is filled. Gas Fee will be paid to miners and will not be subject to discount for Trading Fees. The current Gas Fee is set as 75,000 gas x 8 gwei = 0.0006 ETH. A Maker or Taker may adjust the number of gwei to increase or decrease the Gas Fee, and a higher amount of Gas Fee may accelerate the process of Token exchange on blockchains. If a take- order is unfilled or only partially filled, the remaining part will be restructured into a maker order. Since Gas Fee for the original take-order has been charged already, the remaining make-order will not be subject to any Gas Fee.TAXESIt is your sole responsibility to determine what taxes or levies, if any, apply to the value of Tokens you trade or exchange, and to collect, report, and remit the correct amount of taxes to appropriate tax authorities. Under no circumstances shall Company be responsible for determining whether and what taxes or levies apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising out of or in connection with any transactions you have made, and Company will not be liable for your failure to collect, report, or remit the applicable taxes or levies.To the extent permitted by law, You agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Company or any of its affiliates, employees or agents (including developers, auditors, contractors or founders) harmless for any claim, liability, assessment or penalty with respect to any taxes (other than any net income taxes of the Company resulting from Company's collection of Trading Fees) arising from or in connection with any of Your transaction or exchange of Tokens via the Website.
