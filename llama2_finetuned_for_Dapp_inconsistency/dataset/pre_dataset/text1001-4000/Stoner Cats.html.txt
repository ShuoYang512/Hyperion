Based on Sarah’s personal experience with her mother, Stoner Cats is a story of a woman who uses medical marijuana to alleviate her early Alzheimer’s symptoms and her beautiful family of cats who will do literally anything to save her. Once Mila Kunis and her Orchard Farm Productions partners heard this story, they knew that a hilarious and intimate story like this needed to have deep direct engagement with its audience. So they formed a formidable collective of voice talent, animators, and creatives of all kinds to come together with technology and NFT experts (including the brilliant minds behind CryptoKitties) to bring this story to life using NFTs. 10,420 unique NFTs were created based on the characters in the show. These NFTs were minted and sold on July 27, 2021. 6 episodes of Stoner Cats were produced, accessible only to those holding the NFT digital collectibles. Stoner Cats NFTs gave holders access to the content creators of the show, making it one of the first projects to use NFTs to create a community of holders who get to see behind the curtain as an animated series is made and interact directly with top-level Hollywood talent. Just like its digital collectible NFTs, we believe the Stoner Cats content should live on the blockchain and be accessible for many generations to come. This website and Stoner Cats content will be available in perpetuity using decentralized hosting and archiving service Arweave. We do not control the content and the content can never be removed.
