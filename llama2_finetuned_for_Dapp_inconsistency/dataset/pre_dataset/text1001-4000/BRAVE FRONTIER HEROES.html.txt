gate covered all of Cryptos, and the conventional summoning system ceased to function properly.The Akras Summoner's investigates the gate to determine the cause, and discovers that it leads to the other world of 「Eldoradia」.Although Eldoradia once had a prosperous past, there was no sign of its inhabitants, only the ferocious demons striding about on the remnants of civilization that had been swallowed by the dense wilderness.What was discovered was a mysterious substance called 「Eldoshard」, which occupies most of the land, and research literature on it.Eldoshard is a mysterious ore that contains various information such as people's memories and genes, and according to the literature of the time, people were repeatedly reincarnated through this ore.Based on these documents, Akras Summoner's developed 「Memoria Generation」 which produces memory fragments 「Memoria」 from the Eldoshard that hold information about heroes.Furthermore, they developed the 「Delta Summoning」,which combines these Memorias to summon new heroes.In addition, the Akras Summoner's, considering the danger of being able to summon heroes from resources readily available to anyone, issued 「Brave Power Crystal」 as proof that a summoner is worthy of trust.The rules were revised so that only powerful summoners could summon powerful heroes.With their newfound power, the summoners began to pioneer the ancient city of Eldoradia, where vicious demons were rampant.Unaware that this pioneering work will lead to the resurrection of the vicious 【Twin Gods】...New ExperiencesUnits and new summon
