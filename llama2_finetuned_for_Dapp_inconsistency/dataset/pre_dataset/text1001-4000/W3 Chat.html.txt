We're here to help What is W3 Mail? W3 Mail is a secure mailing protocol that uses Blockchain technology and the Interplanetary File System to provide a highly secure email platform. Emails are securely stored on the distributed IPFS network, and are encrypted using end-to-end encryption. The platform ensures that only the intended recipient can access the message, making it a reliable and secure email communication option for businesses and individuals. How does it work?
