Browse Prints TwelveFold TwelveFold is a limited edition, experimental collection of 300 generative art pieces inscribed onto satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain. These pieces represent a complete art project and will not have other utility or interact with or be related to any previous, ongoing, or future Ethereum-based Yuga projects. View collection Oaxaca In this generative series, I aim to depict a simple life of surf and sun, capturing the essence of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Through geometric micro-textures, I pay homage to a place where nature, culture, and simplicity coexist, representing my home of the past few years.
