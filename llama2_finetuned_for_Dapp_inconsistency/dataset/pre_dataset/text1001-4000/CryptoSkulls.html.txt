RobertHouseCreative I'm addicted to CryptoSkulls. As a social identity NFT they are definitely underrated as they are one of the oldest ERC-721 collections out there. They're also a thinking-person's collectible. On the surface it may seem obvious what skulls you should collect, but as you dig deeper into feature rarity and distribution scarcity, it becomes far more intriguing. Eric P.

The structure of a limited run of 10,000 unique designs forged from a combination of variable traits has gone on to become a popular theme in the space. OG pixelated skulls — a must have for any NFT collector.
