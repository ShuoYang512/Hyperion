A creative world. You can interact with the metaverse inside our mall. The mall will have ways for you to chat with friends and meet new metaverse enthusiasts. You can visit other peopleâ€™s lands that could have been created by a landowner or an actual company. LandBox team will be creating strategic partnerships to help expand the possibilities inside the metaverse. An example of a partnership we could bring on a musician or a designer and they can set up a store highlighting their in-game items for sale.Survival is key in LandBox players will need to do small missions looking for food, helping shops with a small task or even helping an old lady cross the street. Youâ€™ll earn the in-game currency. The in-game currency can be used in various ways.Certain lands will have mini games as well that users can interact with. The LandBox game is an open world for gamers to enjoy the metaverse and creations at LandBox. What will the team LandBox sell? The plans for the sales will be the following and subject to change: - Starter Packs- Game Pass- Skins/Characters- Creator Packs- Land 1x1- Premier Mall Position- Craft Items What will the players of Landbox be able to sell? - Packs- Game Pass- Skins/Characters- Land 1x1- Creations by the Player How does buying land work? There will be a map showing 1000x1000 pixel points, each pixel is equivalent to 1 meter in the real world. Each 1 meter can only hold 4 people per meter. Let's say you buy 1x1 of land, and you invite friends to go to your land, you can only enter up to 4 people online. The bigger the space, the more people online.The more people playing on your land will make it more desirable to the community in terms of gameplay. What can I do on the land? Players will get the opportunity to decorate. All items on the land are turned into NFTs. In the near future items will be able to be crafted and customized. Land owners will be able to create a unique experience on their land from creating minigames or sell/advertise on their land. Future creations such as the dance club will be available so players can create a playlist and become a DJ. Of course a certain character ability will be required for this feature to work as well. Can I create my own skin? No, each skin/character we make is from those who purchased the creator packs (limited) and/or the new skins that may follow a certain trend around the world. Can I create items? Yes you can create a table, car, anything you want to decorate and sell.
