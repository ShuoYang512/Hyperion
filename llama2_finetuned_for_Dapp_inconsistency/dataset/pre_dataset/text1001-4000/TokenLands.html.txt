Joining one of the continents, you get numerous options to get an internal TokenLands currency - T-coin. Each continent has a certain resource necessary for creating an NFT card "War Factory". Military and economic advantage of every player affects the fate of the whole continent.LAND SECTORSNFT cards of varying rarity that contain slots for staking infrastructure facilities, along with the amount of works for Working. Sector owners will get a stable 10% profit margin gained from all facilities placed in their sector, together with profits from all completed works. NFT cards can be purchased in packs with Wax at the pre-sale stage and, in rare cases, at auction with T-coin.WORKINGEvery TokenLands player can earn T-coins on any continent in any available sector absolutely for free. Fulfilling works, you earn T-coin and get a chance to obtain an NFT Evolution card.EVOLUTIONNFT cards of varying rarity that increase profits from Working. Once used, the card is taken out of the system, adding 2% - 10% to the work efficiency. This NFT card can be purchased at auction with T-coin and, in rare cases, can be obtained for free when fulfilling works.STAKINGOwners of NFT cards from the Commercial Objects collection can place them in a free sector on any continent and earn T-coin. It’s the fastest and easiest way to earn T-coin and become an influential Token Lands player.COMMERCIAL OBJECTSA unique collection of NFT cards of varying rarity that allow their owners to earn T-coins by placing them in sectors. Profits from Commercial Objects are fixed and depend on the rarity of the card. More powerful NFT cards can be purchased in packs with Wax at the pre-sale stage, while less powerful cards can be only be bought at auction with T-coin.AUCTIONThe game incorporates an NTF card (infrastructure facilities, sectors, improving player attributes with T-coin) selling system implemented through auctions. NFT cards purchased at auction are less profitable than cards obtained at the pre-sale stage.BANKThe game introduces a T-coin deposit option for terms from 1 to 12 months. The interest rate on the deposit depends on its term. In case of an early withdrawal, the contract interest rate is not charged. Token Lands Bank will run NFT card drawings among investors.MININGEach of the five continents has mines for mining NFT resources. You can use them to build a War Factory or for selling purposes.MINEEach continent has its own mine with a unique NFT resource - metal, glass brick, fuel, and chips. For mining, you will need T-coin. The resources are limited and go with daily updates.WAR FACTORYA mythical NFT card that can only be obtained by crafting unique NFT resources. It’s the most profitable infrastructure facility, which gives you T-coin, along with generating NFT military cards.WARIn a war between the continents, the winner is determined by summarizing powers of all NFT military cards on the continent. The victorious continent gets a week of an increased T-coin mining capability from staking and Working. The concept of war makes it impossible for a continent to win all the time, as well as for players to move to a continent with increased profits.ROADMAPQ4 2021Q4 2021Website launch and social community buildingGame concept presentationNFT cards Series 1 presentation1000 + NFT stacking card AirdropPre-sale NFT Packs series 1Pre-sale NFT Packs series 2Q1 2022Q1 2022Start gameplay:- Launch T-coin and possibility of trading- Working mode- Stacking mode- Auction-Bank functionQ2 2022Q2 2022Gameplay update:- Minning mode- NFT drops of unique resources- WarFactory Craft- NFT cards Series 2 presentationQ3 2022Q3 2022Gameplay update:- WAR is begin- Continent bonus- T-coin StackingBig surprise to all community Q4 2021 Website launch and social community buildingGame concept presentationNFT cards Series 1 presentation1000 + NFT stacking card AirdropPre-sale NFT Packs series 1Pre-sale NFT Packs series 2 Next&nbsp; English (United States) made by roobinium.io © 2021 TokenLands English (United States)TwitterTelegramInstagramDiscord© 2021 TokenLands made by roobinium.ioTOKENLANDS Limited, Reg# 3121648, 19H Maxgrand Plaza, No. 3, Tai Yau street, San Po Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong Director Mr. P.
