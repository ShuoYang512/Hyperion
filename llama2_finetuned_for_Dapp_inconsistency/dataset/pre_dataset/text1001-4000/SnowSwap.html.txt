 User Agreement ⚠️ Please note that this is a Beta version of the SnowSwap DEX. The platform, its software and all content found on it are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. While we have made reasonable efforts to ensure the security and functionality of the SnowSwap platform including forking much of the codebase from existing well-audited projects, and conducting a security review from Quantstamp, many well audited projects have been hacked and exploited leading to users funds being drained. SnowSwap may update it’s codebase which may be unaudited. We strongly advise caution to anyone who chooses to use SnowSwap. PLEASE DO NOT RISK ANY FUNDS YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE. SnowSwap will not be liable to reimburse you for any hacks, exploits, transaction failures or lost funds. Thank you for being a SnowSwap User. (Yes, we care ☃️) I Understand
