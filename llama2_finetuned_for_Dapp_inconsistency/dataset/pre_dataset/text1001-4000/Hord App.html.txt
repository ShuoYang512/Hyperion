ETH staking is the act of locking ETH to help secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants secure the network and, in return, earn rewards. Why stake ETH with Hord? There’s a minimum of 32 ETH and basic technical knowledge required to stake ETH. Staking with Hord greatly simplifies the process, while offering no minimum deposits. What is hETH? The hETH token represents Hord's entire ETH staking pool. hETH is expected to increase in value in relation to ETH as validator rewards are added to the pool. How can I redeem my ETH? For now hETH can be swapped for ETH by trading it on a public DEX like UniSwap. Direct withdrawals will be implemented on the Hord app in October 2023. How does Hord compare with Lido and others? We offer lower fees than most other Liquid Staking Pools while maintaining a simple user experience and no minimums. With Lido controlling a large portion of all ETH staked, there’s a continuous need for additional staking pools to ensure Ethereum remains decentralized and robust. How is the APR calculated? Hord’s APR represents the average return users can expect over the course of a year based on a rolling 7-day average. APR can fluctuate due to reward rate, MEV, and boosted HORD rewards. What happens to the staked ETH? Staked ETH powers the Ethereum blockchain by running validators. ETH is locked while powering a validator but is released when it is exited. Never Miss an Update.
