More DISCORD TWITTER DOCS MEDIUM LINKS SING BRIDGE CHART CONNECT HEREâ€™S WHAT HAPPEND We forked widely used overflow IDO contract and added custom vesting start time functionality. Valleyswap took over the implementation of it and changed some codelines. One of that included the crucial function of setting claimstart time after launching. Seems it is preventing the vesting. What we will do. 1. We'll deploy the IDO contract again and copy all the userdata from current contract. 2. Migrate VSN so that you can start claim as it is. All the funds are safe and it will delay just a few hours of vesting. Don't panic. We'll get it done ASAP.
