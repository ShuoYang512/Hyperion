The process was simple and had useful videos to help break down the setup process and explain the value in having a web3 presence connected to my domain name 🎉😎🎉tearsintherain.nft@PopDomainsI don’t consider myself a domainer. I have no interest in trading .coms &amp; .orgs. I consider myself an Unstoppable domainer, or at most a blockchain domainer.
