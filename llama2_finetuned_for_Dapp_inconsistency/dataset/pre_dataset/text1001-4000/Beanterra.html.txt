Mint Litepaper A beautiful paradise is disappearing... will you be able to save it? Planet Beanterra, a land of boundless beauty, was once the cherished home of the Beanels–diverse and loveable creatures peacefully coexisting with nature. Until that day, when the Bemoths mysteriously appeared and began to devour all forms of life. Now, a group of Earthlings, the last light of hope for the Beanels, seek to restore harmony to Beanterra. Beanels Beanels are the dominant life form on Beanterra. There are 4 classes of Beanels depending on their native habitats, each with different movement abilities and restrictions. TRAIN AND RETALIATE Under the earthling’s leadership, Beanels can strategize, train, and develop tactics to take down Bemoths and uncover their shocking origin. COLLECT AND COMBINE RELICS With the help of various relics, defeat bemoths with ease. Collect relics to power up, combine to craft new relics, or even sell them as NFTs.
