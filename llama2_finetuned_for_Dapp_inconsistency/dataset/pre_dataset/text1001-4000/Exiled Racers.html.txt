Here's a crash course on EXR Race Types. STANDARD RACE The EXR Standard Race is the classic race type with the FASTEST racers to complete the circuit winning. Pick your best stack in this race. INVERSE RACE The EXR Inverse Race is a warped race with the SLOWEST racers to complete the circuit winning. Pick your stack with the worst Speed, Handling, Acceleration and Focus in this race. Inverse racing still uses Intelligence, Aggression, Stamina and Strength so pick a Booster for one of those attributes. OPEN RACE Open races are the base EXR race that do not have a limit with how many racers can enter. Open Races have a 5 Lap distance. After entries close, open races automatically place you into competitive racing groups of up to 5 Racers and auto-simulates your race once the Prediction period ends. DISTANCE RACE EXR Distance races are Open Races with a 10 Lap distance. These races require you to choose stacks with high levels of Strength and Stamina due to an increase in time and length of race.
