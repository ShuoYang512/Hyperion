LIST ITEM FOR SALE Sell your NFTs or crypto here, on GameTrade Our blog Browse more Fri, August 25, 2023 Dive into a world of battles and adventures: The ultimate guide to Splinterlands game Splinterlands is a collectible NFT card game with automated battles that operates on the Hive blockchain. The game offers a range of features such as daily quests, guilds, seasonal rewards every two weeks, and a tournament system. Additionally, players can rent cards securely through the in-game marketplace. If you’re interested in learning how to play this web3-enabled game, this guide will get you started. By simply playing the game, players can earn cards and token rewards. The addition of land gameplay is expected to occur in 2023. Splinterlands Gameplay Overview Splinterlands features one-on-one battles where players select a summoner and a combination of creatures that are either neutral or belong to the same element as the summoner. For instance, Water Summoners can use Water Creatures and Neutral Creatures. Battle info Each Summoner and Monster in Splinterlands has an assigned Mana cost, and the battles are constrained by a limit on the available Mana, which can vary from as little as 11 to as much as 99. Additionally, higher-ranked battles may involve up to three special rules, which can take numerous forms. For example, some matches may allow only melee attacks, or each Monster might start the battle already poisoned, or no Monsters with Magic attack may be allowed. These rules introduce variability from battle to battle and compel players to think strategically about every encounter. In Splinterlands, battles are resolved automatically once initiated. However, selecting cards that complement each other and can potentially counter the opponent is a challenging task. The placement of cards is significant in Splinterlands because the majority of creatures can only target the opposing card in the front position. Melee attack cards can solely attack from the first position, while Ranged ones can only attack when positioned beyond the first spot. On the other hand, Magic creatures can attack from any position and bypass armor. In Splinterlands, the majority of Summoners offer some form of bonus or debuff for the opponent, while numerous Monsters possess abilities, totaling several dozen different ones. These abilities can impact individual cards, team buffs, or enemy debuffs. Examples include Sneak, which targets the enemy Creature in the back, Reflection, which returns half of the received magic damage back to the attacker, and Bloodlust, which boosts the stats of the creature upon getting a kill. Some Monsters even have multiple abilities, particularly at higher levels. As players begin playing Splinterlands, they receive a set of free, account-bound cards to use. How to LVL UP Cards? Splinterlands incorporates an interesting mechanism where cards can level up by combining multiple copies of the same card. As Monsters advance in levels, they gain new abilities and stats that can significantly impact battles. However, the number of cards needed for combining increases with each level. Common cards max out at level 10, Rares at 8, Epics at 6, and Legendary cards at level 4. This feature not only encourages players to continue buying packs but also establishes an ongoing, deflationary method for cards once their production cycle is completed. When players merge cards, the extra ones are destroyed, leading to a decrease in the total supply for that card. However, more important than Monsters leveling up are Summoners leveling up, as the former dictates the maximum Monster level that can be used. For instance, level 1 Rare Summoners can only use Monsters that are level 1 and are barred from using Legendary cards entirely. Additionally, each league in Splinterlands has restrictions on the maximum Summoner level that can be utilized. Players can still use higher-level cards, but their stats will be automatically lowered to match the highest level allowed for the fight. Play-To-Earn Mechanics Splinterlands offers a robust economy, with various rewards such as daily quests, seasonal rewards, leaderboards, and tournaments, which provide additional rewards for those looking for more challenges. While Splinterlands can be played for free, players must purchase a Summoner’s Spellbook for $10 to access rewards. This Spellbook is not an NFT and cannot be traded. It is an account upgrade that grants players access to all aspects of Splinterlands. Winning matches earns players Splintershards tokens and ranking points. Daily quests and end-of-season rewards are also available. The number of reward chests players receive is determined by the number of ranking points they accumulate. Reward chests may contain reward cards, SPS tokens, Merits (used to buy Gladiator packs), Potions, and even card packs. There are two types of Potions, Legendary, and Alchemy, which increase the chances of finding Legendary or Gold Foil cards, respectively. Potions only work when opening card packs, not reward chests. The game also has a tournament system, with weekly tournaments hosted by the Splinterlands team and additional tournaments run by the community. The in-game interface handles everything, eliminating the need for tracking tournaments on a secondary website. Players can join Guilds and participate in twice-weekly team competitions for Guild-related rewards and SPS tokens. Cards and card packs can be sold or traded. In addition to standard reward chests, the top 30 players in each Tier receive a bonus payment of SPS tokens at the end of a season. Beginning on January 31st, 2023, reward cards will be account bound until their print run ends. Duplicates can still be combined to level up cards. Splinterlands Tokens Splinterlands has four main tokens: DEC (Dark Energy Crystals), SPS (Splintershards), Credits (a stablecoin), and Vouchers. To purchase packs and potions in the game, players must use either Credits or DEC, which can be acquired easily through a swap mechanism that accepts Paypal and several different cryptocurrencies. Burning Splinterlands cards or exchanging SPS tokens are ways to obtain DEC. DEC is primarily used in-game for buying, selling, and renting cards. SPS serves as the game’s governance token and is utilized in almost every aspect of the ecosystem. SPS can be used to purchase packs and other Splinterlands items, burned to create new DEC tokens, and may play a significant role in land gameplay. Additionally, players can stake their SPS tokens to vote on game proposals through the in-game interface. Vouchers are exclusive to the Hive blockchain and are utilized for special promotions and events. Daily airdrops of VOUCHERS are received by SPS and Splinterlands license holders. These tokens were previously necessary for early access to Chaos Legion packs and the Waka Spiritblade promotion. All four tokens can be traded on the Hive-Engine market. SPS and DEC tokens can also be transferred to other blockchains, including Ethereum and Binance Chain. Starting Tips The game offers a set of level 1 cards for use, which are not owned by the player, including Summoners and Creatures. New players are encouraged to follow the short tutorial to learn the basics. Afterward, players should experiment with different card combinations and Summoners to gain experience. Summoners are essential for reaching higher ranks. Renting higher-level Summoners can be a good strategy. If building your own set of cards, focus on two or three Summoners. Experiment with different card combinations and strategies. It is not always necessary to use the highest-value cards. Having a specific focus, such as healing, can make a significant difference. Make sure to add a healer if none of your Monsters can self-heal. Check the upgrades available for your cards and sell or rent the ones you do not use. Upgrade the cards that you use frequently. The rental market is an excellent source of high-level cards that can help you reach higher ranks. PeakMonsters is a valuable resource for finding deals and gaining a better overview of the market. Before selecting your team, examine your opponent’s recent match history by hovering over their battle history icons on the start match screen. Identifying a pattern in their playstyle can provide a significant advantage. Gradually work your way up through the ranks. Bronze ranks do not offer significant rewards, so it is best to aim for higher ranks. Once you reach the Silver ranks, you will receive SPS and more cards as rewards, allowing you to level up duplicate cards for stronger teams. Playing steadily daily is better than marathon sessions. Each player has a “Capture Rate” factor that affects the amount of SPS and ranking points they earn from winning matches. The rate decreases with each match and slowly regains over time. Overall Splinterlands is a popular blockchain-based collectible card game that offers players a unique and engaging gaming experience. It features a wide variety of summoners, creatures, and spells that players can collect, upgrade, and use to battle against opponents. The game’s economy is powered by several tokens, including Dark Energy Crystals (DEC), Splintershards (SPS), Credits, and Vouchers, which players can earn, buy, and sell on various blockchain markets. The game is free to play and offers a tutorial for new players to learn the basics. Splinterlands requires a Hive account to play, but they are free to create and offer a secure and straightforward login process. With the rental market, players can rent powerful cards to help them reach higher ranks and earn better rewards. Overall, Splinterlands is an exciting and rewarding game that offers endless possibilities and opportunities for players to strategize and compete against each other.

GAME MODES Deathmatch Players face up to 8 opponents on a map and try to eliminate as many as possible. The player with the most kills at the end of the game is declared the winner. Team Deathmatch Players are randomly divided into groups of 4 and must eliminate opponents. The eliminations of each team member are accumulated, and the team with the highest score at the end of the time limit wins the game. Sniper Shotgun This mode is similar to Deathmatch, but you have a limitation to use only sniper and shotgun weapons. Survival Survival is a game mode that requires two players to work together to defend themselves from non-player characters (NPCs) that attack them. The objective of the game mode is to survive a certain number of rounds without being defeated by the NPCs. TOURNAMENTS ev.io and Fractal have partnered to bring a new set of leaderboards to the free-to-play FPS game, offering players the chance to earn special Platinum Badges by connecting their Fractal wallets and ranking high on the monthly leaderboards. These badges grant access to monthly events with increased prizes, providing additional earning potential for collaborative gameplay. Players who achieve the top 10% of the leaderboard receive the Platinum version of the Proof of Play collectibles, which allow owners to earn 20x the normal match payouts during the next monthly Deathmatch Earn event. Even if players can’t earn the Platinum level reward, they can still craft the collectibles into higher tier versions, which are tradeable on the Fractal marketplace. The ongoing value of these badges means they can continue to provide additional earning potential for collaborative gameplay in future seasons. COLLABORATIVE GAMEPLAY Collaborative gameplay is an important aspect of ev.io, as the game offers several modes where players can team up to face challenges together. The Survival mode, for example, requires two players to work together to fend off waves of non-player characters (NPCs). This mode incentivizes players to communicate and coordinate their efforts to achieve the objective of surviving for a certain number of rounds. Additionally, the Team Deathmatch mode randomly divides players into groups of four, encouraging teamwork and strategizing to eliminate opponents and earn points. Players can also join games with their friends or party to play together and enhance their collaborative gameplay experience. Moreover, the ability to upgrade characters with various abilities and discover new ones adds another layer of collaboration, as players can share knowledge and help each other improve their characters. The NFT system in ev.io also promotes collaborative gameplay, as players can participate in clan wars and PVP gameplay to increase the power level of their NFTs and earn more rewards together. OVERALL Overall, ev.io is a blockchain-based FPS shooter game that offers players a unique gaming experience with various game modes and character personalization through NFTs and upgradeable abilities.

Sat, August 19, 2023 MetaShooter: The Ultimate Real-World FPS Hunting Experience MetaShooter is a real-world simulation-based FPS hunting game. It brings together millions of gamers from all over the world to form a community in which they may engage in realistic hunting in open world environments. How to play? You don’t need NFT to start playing. The game is only available on Steam. All you need to do is go to the game’s page in the store and click the “Request Access” button, after which you will immediately be granted access and can download MetaShooter. The game weighs 3.5 gigabytes. After downloading you must register on&nbsp; https://hunter.metashooter.gg/ Graphics The graphics are beautiful and pleasant. The game is made on the Unreal Engine 5. Gameplay In the main menu, we are greeted with music and a brief guide to the controls and HUD. Then we have to log in to our account, and voila, we’re in the game. The game has two modes: open world and missions. In the open world, we simply choose a weapon and go hunting for animals. Initially, with no NFTs, we only have access to the GLOCK pistol. To be honest, I wasn’t able to kill anyone during an hour of hunting with it in the open world, only injuring wolves a few times, and then I couldn’t catch up with them. Sounds of the surrounding environment, which immerse you in the atmosphere of the hunt. However, the downside is the repetitiveness of the sound effects, because of what they are not very diverse. In missions, we complete specific tasks within a given time frame in order to earn as many points as possible. For example, protecting sheep from wolves, shooting at targets, and so on. Open World Map Map is huge and has many different areas. Each area has its own flora and fauna. As mentioned above, we can only take the Glock with us on the hunt, which is extremely difficult to kill anyone with, so the conclusion is clear: we need to buy NFTs. The same situation applies to moving around the world — we need a vehicle, which is also an NFT. The core gameplay aspect of MetaShooter is hunting to receive NFT rewards such as NFT animal trophies of the player hunted and MHUNT tokens. There are three different types of hunting in which players can participate, requiring different NFT guns and items. These are Herbivore Hunting, Carnivore Hunting, and Bird Hunting. Players can hunt under different types and weather conditions such as day or night, stormy, rainy, or normal weather. Because hunting zones are less crowded during stormy or nighttime conditions, the hunter’s chances of catching a rare animal increase. In addition, the hunter will need to purchase better equipment, such as scopes and thermal optics. If the hunter attempts to hunt with inappropriate equipment for a specific animal, not only will their chances of success decrease, but if the animal spots the hunter, it may attack and damage their equipment. One of the best NFT animal trophies will be in the deeper forests, so the hunter will need to purchase NFT vehicles to travel longer distances and overcome the harsh terrain. With NFT vehicle, hunter can take more additional guns and equipment. If a player plays online, he can drive his hunting partners too. In game character will deliver an NFT vehicle into the location where the player starts. If a player has its own land, he can place his vehicles there. To increase the odds of a successful hunt, the player will be able to buy animal callers, baits, or dogs from the marketplace. If the hunter already has some common trophies and a knife, they can use his trophy as bait to hunt more unique and rare animals. They will also be able to use NFT dogs to track down animals and their locations. Dogs can be used also to bring hunted trophies in order to save stamina. Missions Game has 4 missions: Shooting Range, Farm Defense, Mallard Hunt and Gifts Hunt. You get scores for completing missions. It’s important, because if you have your wallet connected, you receive a HUNTERS token (BNB Chain): The HUNTERS token serves as the reward for competing in MetaShooter. You earn them by finishing in the top 100 on the respective leaderboards. More functionality is on the way for HUNTERS; you can stake them, swap them, or buy NFTs with them. So it’s important to get as many scores as possible. HUNTERS are distributed automatically daily, at midnight. Tournaments Hunters will be able to participate in hunting tournaments, where they will be able to test their equipment abilities and hunting strategies to compete for prize funds. There will be several tournaments depending on the hunters’ level. To compete, the player will need to purchase a tournament ticket. Hunting land owners will be able to participate in tournaments, as well. The ownership will guarantee them the opportunity to host their public tournaments in their hunting plot. The prize fund will depend on the plot size and animal variety. Tournaments will be online divided into player pools. Hunters who are not able to complete particular challenges during a given time will be eliminated, the last player wins. There will be three types of tournaments: Solo hunting Duos hunting 5 player hunting How to connect and merge wallets?

There are a total of four missions to complete daily. Following the completion of a mission’s objectives, players have the opportunity to further increase their score by hunting in the Open World (10 points for each hunted animal). Total score is calculated from the 4 missions and hunted animals in the open world. You can check your ranking here: &nbsp;https://hunter.metashooter.gg/leaderboard The rewards are distributed each day at midnight straight to your connected and merged wallet in the hunter.metashooter.gg dashboard. You can add HUNTERS in your Metamask or other wallets. Token Address — 0x71E044E166793D2391931aF427cF146Fe9e939cf Token Symbol — HUNTERS Token Decimal — 18 Earned rewards HUNTERS you can stake, swap to MHUNT, use on hunter.metashooter.gg Each hunted trophy NFT will have its own value depending on the caught animal’s rarity and condition. If hunters first shot is not critical and he needs another one to hunt the trophy, automatically the trophy value will decrease and the hunter will receive less reward. The player will be able to sell trophy NFTs on the marketplace or exchange them for MetaShooter NFT equipment or services. If the player hunts down an epic or rare animal, they will be rewarded with MetaShooter (MHUNT) tokens. Another way to receive an MHUNT token reward will be to hunt an animal from a particular region common trophy collection. Each collection will consist of 10 different regional animals. If the hunter successfully catches all the animals from the collection, they will be rewarded. The hunters will have the opportunity to participate in tournaments where winners will be rewarded by various NFTs and compete for a prize fund collected from entry fees. Plot owners will receive rewards collected from tournament entry fees. The bigger land, the bigger reward percentage owner will receive. If a hunter hunts down a trophy in land owner territory, the owner receives a small percentage from hunted animal value. Same situation happens for tower owners; if a hunter uses the owner’s tower to hunt down prey, the owner receives a small percentage. If the land owner has a hunting house he can use it for his own rest or he can rent it to the other players. The player can convert their common trophies to meat baits or dog breeding fodder and sell them on the marketplace Daily Quests Here is a comprehensive list of&nbsp; EPIC MetaShooter NFTs . You might have a chance to win one, if you check in every day for the next 30 days. Saiga 12 Jimmy Old Fashioned Mammuth R25 Whispers Chester 98 Fixed-blade knife YGX 450 Raptor V1 Everest Borisko https://hunter.metashooter.gg/daily-quests Hunting Business To start, hunters goal is to buy hunting land where player can develop his business The players’ goal is to build hunting houses, towers, breed NFT dogs, host tournaments and monetize the land’s resources. Token Economy MetaShooter Token The MetaShooter (MHUNT) token is a Polygon (Matic) blockchain-based cryptographic token that can be traded on the Polygon blockchain. This token will be used as the main currency on the MetaShooter platform as an independent store of value for players and investors. Using the MetaShooter (MHUNT) token in NFT trades, purchases, or donations, will provide users with significantly lower transaction fees. The MHUNT token has a significant value for the whole platform. MetaShooter offers its tokens as a payment option, and ultimately all transactions will be carried out using MetaShooter tokens. All NFT purchases, sales, generation, listing, donations, rewards, and DAO will be held in the MHUNT token. This will guarantee the constant token volume and circulating supply. Deposits via cryptocurrency or traditional payment methods like a credit card, PayPal, and others, will be automatically and transparently converted to MHUNT tokens (by purchasing them from coin holders) which will then be used to complete the transaction. The referral and reward systems will also use MetaShooter tokens. Wallet users, influencers, social media accounts, blogs, and news outlets will all receive their referral rewards in MetaShooter tokens. The token will rely on the principle of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which will be very beneficial for the token economy and will increase user experience. How much money you can earn 1 $HUNTERS = 0.5208333333333334 MHUNT = $0.005208333333333334 Let’s say that 1$HUNTERS ~ $0.00521. Min. amount to swap is 500$HUNTERS. Per top 51–100 you receive 2.5$HUNTERS, per top 1–300$HUNTERS. This means that by playing every day and occupying the 51–100 place, you can exchange 500 $HUNTERS after 200 days of daily play (with minimal time investment). Over these 200 days, you will receive ~$2.6 without considering all fees — just pennies. By occupying daily top 1, you can exchange $HUNTERS almost daily after two days of play, let’s say you will exchange 600 $HUNTERS every two days. We get $3.126 / 2 days without including fees -&gt; $1.563 / day -&gt; $10.941 / week -&gt; $328.23 / month. That is, you can earn either $2.6 / 200 days or $2,188.2 / 200 days.
