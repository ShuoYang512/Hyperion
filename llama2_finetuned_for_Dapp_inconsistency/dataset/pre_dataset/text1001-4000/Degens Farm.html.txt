SEASON I: CREATURES The First Season at our farm is all about a unique distribution model , where the rarest creatures could only be farmed. Users are able to combine creatures and lands to farm ultra-rare species. There are 2000 unique normies waiting to give birth to 400 chads, and then ultimately chads are to breed 20 rare d e g e n s ! Each creature is producing $DUNG that could be used to get tools and plant your trees! More info about the first Season in our docs.
