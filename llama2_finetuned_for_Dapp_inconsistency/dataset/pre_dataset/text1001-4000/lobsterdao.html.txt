It‚Äôs a loot box where you can pull out one of the cool pieces: a shrimp, a langoustine, a lobster, and‚Ä¶ something else? Nobody will know in advance, that‚Äôs also why it's fun. The collection contains 6751 pieces and is fully done by Klibansky , a famous contemporary artist. The distribution of the pieces is aimed at members who have contributed research to the chat, about 83% of the total supply goes to them initially. A few of the pieces were also reserved for known NFT collectors and all the unclaimed go to governance. Over a thousand holders at first, thanks to over 3 years of the community forming together! Are you still not a lobster? NGMI! Read below to learn wtf this is. 10b57e6da0 NFT Seafood Drop - Traits? The sea kingdom consists of various creatures, with its lore having almost no boundaries! Humans don‚Äôt even know to this date if the deep oceans have fully been explored‚Ä¶ So as the crypto industry. There is a lot of research going on every day, primitives are developed as more developers join us. Therefore, the lore of the two is similar. Going with that story and given that lobsters are about crustaceans, the collection features a shrimp, a langoustine, a lobster... You would expect the evolution to occur that way, but maybe the community decides to have the inverse? That can change any moment! Are you a diamond hands lobster or sand hands dumping the bottoms? Are you a fat meaty holder or a rekt shrimp? - You can maybe find yourself in this collection. The collection has different rarity traits, inspired by cryptopunks and other pfp projects, because it just works. But instead of having the usual cigarette-cap-etc. the rarity comes from different materials of the claws, the backgrounds, and so on. It‚Äôs more about aesthetic enjoyment, so don‚Äôt let the original holders or anyone else dictate you if something is better or rarer. The collection has 7.5% royalties (initially) 70% of that goes to DAO governance that is managed by community multisig, and 30% goes to the artist side. While the collection is not an NFT project, this allows the collection to have some longevity and cooperation possible, in case holders decide they want to do something. They also don‚Äôt have to do anything. Royalties are unfortunately, due to how NFT markets are, are kind of an old hand-maintained manual work‚Ä¶ but it would be great to change this as EIP-standards develop in this direction. We are aware of EIP2981 , but this doesn‚Äôt really change much with regard to how Opensea works. Update 2023: Opensea, as well as some other marketplacs, have forcefully removed royalties. Check yourself what's the best marketplace for you. The royalties and fees might not be harmonized anymore, because there is no promise of work or contributions here. It's set up to be free &amp; open, not managed by anyone. The collection can have a snapshot page for governance Snapshot page https://snapshot.org/#/10b57e6da0.eth can be used together with multisig in order to decide what to do with NFTs or any other in the multisig. The collection or the NFTs have no governance over chats, rules, or anything else related to people. It's just governance for fun, and has no value or utility. It's just there to potentially align community in a better way. 1 LOBS NFT = 1 vote. Currently, 3 NFTs minimum threshold to create a proposal. This can be changed later. The process is as follows: create an ISSUE to discuss something (on github, not in chats) and then make snapshot proposal after some time of discussions taking place. How to get one? Distribution transparency This is, unfortunately, not a money grab, and we kinda all have ethos (read below)... which sucks! As such, the distribution is fully aimed at existing contributing members getting 83% of the collection. All are verifiable real people who have been amazing contributors sharing news, alpha, research, their knowledge. They are what Lobsters are about. You can get one if you are: On the list as linked below, being either Lobsters Chat or NFT Avenue contributor . People who throughout the years have been active, are being assigned these seafood pics. Because most of the spam in Lobsters gets deleted, activity quite closely corresponds to value add. The raw data was taken from open Telegram stats by zhongfu, after which Alex P took the active days, messages, replies, and other criteria‚Äôs square roots in order to make the distribution as fair as possible. Had we not done that, the skew to the top would have been much bigger. And it would have been fine! But everyone in the community wants to maintain the ethos, so what was done is done. Having been involved with developers trying to put things together, which is mentioned on the second sheet of the excel ‚Äúextra‚Äù. Thanks for their work, blz no rug! They did good work with the tech concepts, snapshot page, and editing this repo lol. Being a holder of one of the creme de l√° creme of NFT summer collections CryptoPunks (125), Bored Apes (75), Loot (50) - will let you claim on FCFS basis one of the pieces per collection respectively. These communities were one of the most impactful in the NFT space, so honouring them seemed sensible. According to that, over 371 will be remaining for the DAO governance by 10b57e6da0 NFT holders , which has its own snapshot page and its own multisig of community members. They can be used for whatever the holders decide, and can also be for‚Ä¶ nothing. Unclaimed pieces from the lists above will also go to DAO. UPDATE 09.10: the bot registrations together with extra participation badges count up to 3214 pieces - which is the total merkle. Next to that, 250 were for all the collections. In total, participants can claim 3464. The DAO will have 3287 remaining. This is not what was envisioned at the start as 83% was supposed to go to chat memmbers, but after &gt;1 week people just stopped registering... can't force people to get NFTs if they don't want to! If you don‚Äôt qualify as either one of the people above - there is no other way to get it. There is no sale, muh friend allocation, or whatever. Here is the link to the distribution sheet related to which members got how much: IPFS link 1 and link 2 or if it dies, here is the google link which might also die after some time. With using this link you can see how to check if you are eligible for a drop and get your Telegram ID. How will the process work? The distribution and the model were discussed openly for weeks, nothing was gated. The collection was technically prepared by a few amazing contributors, thanks to them. When the telegram bot is up, you need to submit your address to the bot (see more in privacy notice at the bottom) within the time specified. If you miss the slot, you are ngmi, that‚Äôs over then. All the pieces which are not claimed will go to DAO. Update 08.10: about 1250 people mamaged to register with the bot, and about 10 messaged in time to get added manually. That's about 35% of people representing over 50% of the supply. A merkle tree and root are generated and then uploaded into the contract. Once the contract is up, you will be able to use that address and claim it on UI which will match it with the merkle. At this point, you will just have an NFT unique token but no image to be seen, nothing yet. If the UI is down, just claim with the contract directly: here is the merkle and the conract is at the top of this readme. After a few days, the Contract Owner multisig will generate the seed based on Chainlink VRF which then matches the path to IPFS storage where the collection was pre-uploaded. This way, developers promise randomization of the loot box concept will be fully transparent! Which is cool because it's like a reveal ceremony. After the seed is generated, people can technically know what piece they got attributed. Then the tokenURI changes to the right path as assigned everywhere, and the collection is considered deployed. The bot and its database are promised to be deleted, and the work is done. Somebody should make a snapshot page and assign multisig. Done. Don‚Äôt expect any work. Collect the art and piss off &lt;3 ERC20 ideas lobsterdao will not ever make an official ERC20 (and any other form of token). There is strong consensus against it. Do not fall into scams and impersonations. If anything is to be made by anyone, it should not be endorsed. Why 6751? LobsterDAO‚Ä¶ 10b57e6da0‚Ä¶ 105760‚Ä¶ Now try the inverse, like looking at your own reflection: 067501. Remove the zeros and you end up with a number. It seemed cute because there are over 3000 active members. And a few of them get more than 1. The name meme came from Curve deployment during DeFi summer of 2020, read more here . What is Lobsters Chat and its ethos? How did it all begin? Blockchain Lobsters as a channel and then as a chat-community have existed since summer 2018 when the 2 year bear market carnage was going on in full force. It spawned out after CCR (CryptoCodeReviews) chat was closed by the Air Conditioner in 2018. But there was a need to ask semi-technical and economic research questions, so Lobsters took that role for some. We try not to gamble too much, and focus on product things. Unless we get drunk! There was never a coin, marketing, or anything monetary involved. Just a place to research anything-crypto, share ideas, ask questions. Perhaps, this is why some like the chat. It will stay that way, as the ethos is to remain impartial, simply sharing knowledge and opportunities. Anyway, the rest is history, all the conversations are open after all. Read back, ctrl+f on some topics, and feel free to contribute new information. &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; Integration ideas: things one could do with 10b57e6da0 NFT There are a few ways other builders can use 10b57e6da0 NFTs beyond what pfps entail: Inspired by loot, the collection can be split into metadata pieces and build a game on top of the main collection, and perhaps even make the traits re-interact with each other. The initial list of the distribution very strongly represents active and knowledgeable users, fully anonymized. As such, that list is quite valuable as a snapshot of DeF-native users who are active. Perhaps, cool teams like DegenScore can implement this as an extra gateway of powerful users, or other teams can decide to use this list for retroactive protocol airdrops. Is it better to use NFT list or initial list? It makes more sense to use an NFT holder list at the time when you are using this idea because (i) some members became active post-distribution (ii) there could be future distributions. Therefore, using initial list-only is not going to cover all current-active members. Reach out to DAO for help! See an example . The royalties occurring go to governance after all, so the DAO can decide whatever else to sponsor, foster, or enable. The possibilities are there if someone wants it. NFTs can be used to get preferential treatment at conferences or as a ticket to anywhere from a discord server to a conference in the real world. Privacy concerns, legal words, and disclaimers No admin keys are in possession of any single person (unless anon devs rug), no development is planned. It is literally an NFT drop and that is it, nothing more is promised to be done or will be done with these NFTs. They are just art. You claim a piece of art and then you piss off! They don‚Äôt have a price and don‚Äôt have any un-emotional value. No conversations about their trading or related topics will be tolerated whatsoever. A few things to point out: It must be said that this is an open-contributor project. Developers who helped bring this together are mostly anon, and nobody knows if they are good at what they do or not. They just took the time to put it together. The code can have bugs, the approvals you set up can steal your money, anything can happen. There is no company or financial benefit to even perform an audit, so keep this in mind. You can lose both your money and your sanity. Nobody will keep working on developing some games or whatever, the collection is more in the style of ‚Äúpfp‚Äù aka profile picture related. There are no admins who will help you with questions. Forget about these things. When it comes to the bot distribution, it‚Äôs also hosted by anon devs, so they may steal your data as in the wallet associated with your telegram account. Will they? Nobody knows. Most likely they won‚Äôt. Just use a new clean wallet if it bothers you. Rules about communications. The discssions on governance can = happen here in ISSUES as preliminary ideas - and then submitted to snapshot for voting. The main LobsterDAO chat will not tolerate random proposals (unless genuinely useful) or some random ideas-questions. NFT Avenue should be kept clean as well. Community chat is open for all! The chat will not get polluted by random pfp sharing or asking for prices or anything. As stated above, there is no team or person responsible for anything. After a week from launch, sharing pictures or random stuff about the collection will be heavily moderated. Nobody will hand-hold you to do anything, because everything is explained here. If you didn't read the disclaimers or all other information, you can be muted. Don't cry later that somebody didn't explain to you something. There is no company with support serivce.
