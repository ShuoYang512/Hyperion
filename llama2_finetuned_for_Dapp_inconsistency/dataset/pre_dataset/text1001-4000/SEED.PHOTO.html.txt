I live in the city of Moscow in Russia. Marital status: married, mother of five children.I've been doing photography since I was 17, but I started taking pictures professionally in 2010. I tried myself in different genres: from subject shooting to wedding photography. But in 2019, I discovered the world of art photography and realized that this is exactly the kind of photography that I want to do. In my performance, art is historical, fantasy, fabulous photography. I am constantly developing in this direction: every year I plan and go through training. At the moment, I have a permanent makeup artist in my team who implements the most daring make-up. I also work with the best costume rentals in Moscow and the Moscow region. I know decorators who can make almost any location.My projects are getting more and more complicated every year. I do the organization myself: from the idea to the presentation of photos to the public. For me, every new project becomes a challenge, but will I be able to?Through my photos, I talk to the viewer, share my thoughts and experiences.At the moment, I have more than 20 publications of my projects in foreign and domestic magazines in my piggy bank.Briefly about my achievements:- silver award in the WPE individual competition in the second half of 2021;- silver award in the WPE Portrait Creative nomination for the first half of 2022;- winner (1st place in the Grand final ART AWARD nomination: photography) Golden Talent;- TOP 150 autographs in the nomination "State autograph" according to the version 35 awards 2021;- TOP 35 staged photos of 2019, 2021;- TOP 50 autographs of Moscow according to 35 awards.

Emotional and expressive B&amp;W portraits are my trademark. My style is characterized by minimalism, the focus is on the person, not the packaging.
