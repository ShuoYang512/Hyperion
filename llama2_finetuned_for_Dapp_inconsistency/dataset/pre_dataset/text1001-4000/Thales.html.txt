This is why ThalesDAO, as a collective, is the owner of the protocol and it conducts governance through the Thales Council, elected by THALES token holders.Why does it matter?Because building on the right foundations attracts like-minded people who care deeply about the open finance vision. With the support of bright minds, talented souls, and passionate people from the Thales community the protocol gets iterated, battle-tested, and more resilient every day.
