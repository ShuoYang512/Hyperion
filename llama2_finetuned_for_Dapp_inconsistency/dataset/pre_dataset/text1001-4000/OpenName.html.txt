OpenName is an Omnichain Name Service built for millions of Web3 users, which has supported Seamlessly Cross-chain names transfer by utilizing LayerZero and has supported Custom Suffixes for communities. How to understand the concept of eliminating domain level? As we all know, traditional WEB2 domains have a hierarchical relationship. For example, the WEB2 domain "app.open.name" is a subdomain of "open.name" and can only be created by the domain owner of "open.name".In OpenName, the creation of the WEB3 domain "app.open.name" does not require the consent of the domain owner of "open.name". These are two independent WEB3 domains with no hierarchical relationship between them Why eliminate the domain level? OpenName eliminates the hierarchical relationship between levels of domains, ensuring that users are not limited by hierarchy when creating domain names. This allows for the creation of more personalized and uniquely identifiable domain names, maximizing the freedom of domain name creation (Freedom Maximize) and providing a platform for users to express their creativity more freely. What is the Multi-Chain Domain System? The Multi-Chain Domain System refers to the deployment of OpenName's smart contracts on multiple public blockchains. By utilizing this system, domain names can be transferred across any of the supported public blockchains within the OpenName ecosystem, while retaining their full range of domain services and functionality. This implementation achieves a truly multi-chain environment for domain management. Is OpenName decentralized? Yes, OpenName is a decentralized domain system that operates on multiple blockchains. What are the differences between OpenName and other domain services? * We have eliminated domain level , allowing users to freely create domain names without hierarchical limitations.* We provide diverse suffix options, offering users a wide range of choices.* We have achieved multi-chain functionality, enabling domain names to operate on multiple chains.* We have implemented true cross-chain domain name transfers, allowing seamless movement of domain names across different chains.
