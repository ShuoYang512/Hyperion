PLAY NOW WE ARE AVAILABLE ON Have a question? frequently asked questions What is Goldmand? Goldmand is a GameFi platform that aims to build a sustainable ecosystem through P2E games, Staking, Yield Farming and Reward Programs. On which blockchain does the platform work? Currently we are only running on the WAX Blockchain, but we have plans to expand us to the Binance Smart Chain in the future. To know how to create a WAX wallet, please click here. What games are available in Goldmand? Currently only our Mining Game is available. The next game to be released will be Goldmand Battle Arena, which is planned for early Q3. What are the tokens that I can earn with Goldmand? Our economy is based on a circular model with three main tokens that feed each other: GMF (Goldmand Food), GMM (Goldmand Mineral) and GME (Goldmand Energy). But also, the model has a fourth token: the GMD (Goldmand), a utility token required for various functions and whose main source of issuance is as reward for contributing to our Liquidity Pools. How can I earn playing the Mining Game? To start playing you need to log in here, create an account and choose a race. Once you have chosen your race you must choose a Land to mine. The next thing will be to equip at least 1 tool and deposit enough tokens to consume and execute the mining attempt. After you get your rewards, you can keep your profit margin and trade the rest to get enough resources to consume and mine again. How can I earn by providing Liquidity? To provide Liquidity you must enter here to create your pairs and stake the amount you want. According to your percentage of participation, you will be assigned with an amount of GMD that you can mine throughout the day. Where can I sell and buy tokens? You can sell and buy our tokens in the Alcor Market, or you can also do it in the internal Swap that we have in the Mining Game. How can I buy NFTs? Our NTFs can be purchased on WAX markets that support the AtomicAssets standard, such as AtomicHub or Neftyblocks What makes Goldmand NFTs different? As we aim to create an infrastructure that intertwines our games, Goldmand NFTs will be able to be used (in one way or another) in all of them. Where can I find more info? Our Ecosystem document as well as the Goldmand Battle Arena Whitepaper are still being designed. For now you can read the Whitepaper of our Mining Game, and also our Medium.
