Coming Soon V A U L T Whenever a transaction takes place on PADSwap, a portion of the fees go to the Vault . The tokens accumulated in The Vault act as a backing for PAD, giving it real value in underlying tokens (such as BNB, BTC, ETH, and any other tokens used on PadSwap). By giving users the ability to burn PAD at any time and receive its backing, the Vault creates a permanent price floor and guarantees that PAD will always have value.
