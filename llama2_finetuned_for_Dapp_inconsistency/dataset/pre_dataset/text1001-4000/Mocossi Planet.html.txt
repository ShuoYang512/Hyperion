Since then, scientists have been experimenting with resources from this planet. Unfortunately, our size and physical condition limit our ability to fully farm for resources on Mocossi. Scientists have also confirmed that there exist lovely, plump-body creatures with characteristics that resemble pets on Earth. The first species discovered on planet Mocossi was known as ITO (intelligent &amp; true-blue object) for its intelligence and loyalty. Meanwhile, all creatures on this planet (including yet to be discovered species) are given the common name - Mocomon. In an ambitious plan devised by scientists, mankind is projected to live peacefully with Mocomons on this planet while keeping Mother Earth from suffering resource shortages or environmental damage.The first step is to develop a breeding program to conduct genetic research and to expand the Mocomon population. At least two ITOs must be involved in breeding. ITOs require a seven-day cooldown period after each breed. An ITO can only breed a maximum of ten times in its lifetime. Mocossi Planet Mocossi Planet is one of the first play-and-earn games on the Cardano blockchain. It is different from other traditional virtual pet games in that it incorporates both virtual pet and farming simulation elements and implements smart contracts in its in-game ecosystem. Apart from being entertained, players can earn real money as a reward for their contribution to the growth of our ecosystem.

Founder and CEO of Arthur J Goldman Consultants providing industry expertise to Governments and FTSE100 companies in GRC, information and cyber security. My crypto journey started in late 2017, since then I have participated in Cardano ITN and now provide SaaS (Stakepool As A Service) for Cardano SPOs, alongside operating [KING1] Stakepool. I was a late bloomer to NFTs and joined in October 2021. I had a simple philosophy ‚Äúsweep the floor and raise the roof‚Äù with a moto ‚Äúgo heavy or go home‚Äù hence researched projects with solid teams, vision, execution and delivery capability, this is how I ended up at Mocossi Planet. DIRASHI ‚ÄúMocossi is one of my favorite projects in the entire NFT space, I've owned Mocossi NFTs since mint and have been following the project's progress ever since. I hold the team to a very high standard of quality and professionalism because they've consistently shown they'll settle for nothing less.

I trust and believe in the team's vision of Mocossi Planet and can't wait to begin this journey üî•!‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm a die hard crypto/NFT enthusiast and a true degen at heart. I've only been in the crypto space for around 2 years, but have gained a ton of new skills &amp; made friendships along the way! I began trading Cardano NFTs with around 500 ada &amp; worked my way up to where I am today. Nowadays, I consistently buy NFTs on the Big 3 (Cardano, Ethereum, Solana). I hold a ton of different projects but some of the more popular ones are: Mocossi, Deadpxlz, Clay Nation, Chilled Kongs, Deadfellaz, Gutter Cats, Degentoonz &amp; Famous Fox Federation.‚Äù DAVID KING ‚ÄúI was excited to become an ambassador for Mocossi because I believe the project will showcase how gaming and crypto concepts, such as NFTs and DeFi, can compliment each other.
