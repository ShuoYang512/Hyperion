It is incredibly exciting when you're looking to make a trade on a DEX, and bring some profits to the table. That is how trading is supposed to feel exciting. But it doesn't. Times have changed, there is too much noise to cut through to find the best prices for your trades. 99% of new projects fail, and trading manually on top DEXs would take too long. DEX trading needs some rethinking. A fresh take. At Symphony, that's what we're trying to do - simplifying trading by automating the most time consuming part, while giving an opportunity to earn extra yield.We automate yield generation, trades filling or execution and fund transfer. So the only thing you need to do is: create an order. Traders prefer Symphony because it saves them from headaches caused by unfilled orders and slow order execution. We think it is a start. To make DEX trading exciting again. Let's get tradin'. Best, Team Symphony PS: We love crypto, but our government doesn't. In fact, all crypto-related activities are heavily punished here.
