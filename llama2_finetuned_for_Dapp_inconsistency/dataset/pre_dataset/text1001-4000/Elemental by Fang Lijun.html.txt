The compositions of each image convey the impact of an intense collision. Elemental is inspired by Fang’s work with ceramics, which he has always regarded as a medium for exploring materiality and tacility. It’s an art form that has advanced through technological innovation, as large-scale production and standardization have made art serve everyday needs. In each NFT, a model of a ceramic plate bearing a portrait floats in an abstract environment evocative of environmental chaos, presenting a paradox between chance and necessity, eternity and fragility, creation and disappearance. To commemorate the new year, Elemental consists of 2022 NFTs. Fang has created 200 still images in editions of 10, as well as 22 single-edition animations. Collectors of the one-of-one editions will be able to claim ceramic plates.
