Our product focuses on providing tooling for smooth NFT distribution. We do not offer contract creation services for NFTs. However, we can recommend someone from our network who can build one for you. If you are developing the NFT contract on your own, we can offer advice on how to meet basic requirements. Who pays the blockchain network fees? In Linkdrop, there are two options for covering fees: The end user pays all fees. When the user receives the claim link and follows it to claim an NFT, they will need to pay for both the gas and the Linkdrop claiming fee. This option makes link creation free for the creator, but it shifts the cost to the user. ‚Äç The creator pays all fees. When the user receives the claim link and follows it to claim an NFT, they will not be charged. The gas will be covered by the proxy contract. The creator will pay for link creation and, depending on the chosen plan, either pre-pay the gas for transactions or reimburse the gas for all claims at the end of the month.
