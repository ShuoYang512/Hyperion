First and foremost, we are timelocked, so new tokens cannot be minted. All tokens originating from wallet 0x00000000.. are obtained as a prize when you defeat a monster. The second point is that, as previously said, the total quantity of Tokens in Fight Monster is 140 million. Tokens are distributed at initial: 570 million tokens. 570 million tokens + 140 million tokens = 710 million tokens. So what happens if this quantity of tokens is exceeded? We have a very clear plan for this; so far, more than 20,000 NFTs have been sold, resulting in a total of 260 million tokens gathered from the community. This tokens will continue to be used for project development (Fight Monsters, Bosses, Training, Farming, ...) Our Max Total Supply Is 1 Billion.

Dev are Doxxing or Not? Because crypto currency has not been approved by the government in our country due to a legal issue, anonymity is required for the time being. Sushiswap and YFI are examples of successful projects with anonymous developers. In Code We Trust is a phrase used in the crypto currency area. Many projects, such as NanoDoge, continue to rug-pull when the developer is doxxed. As a result, Doxxing is a bit of a misnomer. Contract Owner can set sell fee to 100%?
