 The MurAll Draw Trade Stats Artists Connect Wallet Ethereum Polygon What is MurAll? MurAll is a collaborative canvas allowing artists worldwide to paint onto an ever evolving piece of art. This is a first of its kind project made possible by the use of blockchain technology, allowing anyone anywhere in the world to draw whatever they like without restrictions on what they can draw. Introducing PAINT MurAll requires a digital token called PAINT to enable artists to draw onto the canvas. Each PAINT token can draw 2 pixels and just like real life paint, it can only be used to draw once. If is has been used it can’t be taken off of the wall and reused! With only a finite amount of PAINT available globally (there is only enough PAINT to cover the canvas 21,000 times), it is a commodity which encourages artists to produce work they are passionate about as the more PAINT that is used, the less is available. Your NFT Once an artist has created their piece and “minted” it on the MurAll canvas, it is immortalised forever on the blockchain. The artist receives an NFT (Non Fungible Token) of their drawing; in contrast to traditional tokens, NFTs are one of a kind, ensuring that the artwork is a UNIQUE ORIGINAL which has value and can be kept or sold whenever they wish - just like real life paintings. Unlike most existing technologies, the artwork itself is contained within the token and isnt just a certificate. Now with AI Unleash your creativity with our AI-powered text to image generation, designed to make artistic expression accessible to everyone, regardless of skill level, creating a truly diverse and inclusive digital mural for all to enjoy. Whether you're a seasoned artist or a beginner, our advanced AI can transform your thoughts and ideas into stunning visuals, bridging the gap between imagination and the canvas.
