Step 1: For guaranteed allocation, you need to Buy $CXPAD on PancakeSwap : https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xe90d1567ecef9282cc1ab348d9e9e2ac95659b99 and meet our tiered criteria. Please check CoinxPad Levels here: https://cex.coinxpad.io/levels . Step 2: Fund your wallet with $USDT to participate in the upcoming IDO. Step 3: Check all the upcoming IDO's on https://cex.coinxpad.io/ and complete the registration in time to get the guaranteed allocations. Some projects require KYC and some of them may need your wallet address to be whitelisted. So, please complete whatever required. KYC once done is applicable for all future projects. All the details are provided on the IDO details page. Step 4: Visit IDO's page: https://cex.coinxpad.io/ at the IDO's launch time and connect your wallet (pre funded with $CXPAD and $USDT) and then buy allocated amount of tokens based on your tier or whatever max it will allow you. Is registration mandatory for each IDO? Yes, each project is unique and they have different requirements like KYC or whitelisting. So, you must register for each project explicitly before the registration ends. Registration will end 2 hours before IDO start date and time. What are the CoinxPad levels and How long do I need to maintain $CXPAD balance? The CoinxPad levels give you an advantage of getting guaranteed allocations based on available pool size. You need to maintain required $CXPAD balance from the IDO registration date to the IDO allocation date (generally after 24 hours after the IDO end date). If you sell your $CXPAD before the IDO launch time, you will not be eligible to participate in that IDO. What are guaranteed and lottery allocations? All the holders that meet CXPAD tier levels will get guaranteed allocations based on pool size and after registration for IDO. All users in the same tier will get same guaranteed allocation. Allocation of Diamond holder will be 8 times (8X) the allocation of Gold holders and allocation of Platinum holders will be 4 times (4X) the allocation of Gold holders. Guaranteed allocation will be available for 2 hours after IDO is opened. Any unsold allocation will be available for all CXPAD holders on a first come first serve round basis (who comes first will get a chance to participate in IDO). Even this is capped per tokenholder to ensure that the whole allocation does not go to one individual. 10 allocations per IDO will be rewarded to CXPAD holders (below Gold tier) through random lottery with allocations equal to Gold tier. Lottery winners will be announced 1 hour before the IDO and they can contribute during the IDO. Purchasing more $CXPAD after IDO registration is closed gives me more allocations? No, once the registration is completed, we take a snapshot of our users and holdings so the new $CXPAD you bought will not give you more allocations with the current round but help you get more allocations with the next IDO’s. Which currency do you accept for IDO's? We go with $USDT as it's one of the popular stable coin. You need to fund your wallet with CXPAD to meet the required tier for the guaranteed allocation and then have some $USDT to participate in the IDO's. How to find IDO results that I participated? Generally, within 24 hours after the IDO end date, you will get all the allocated tokens in your wallet. You need to find the wallet address of the project that you have participated and add it to your wallet so that you can see how many tokens you have received. If there is any discrepancies, you can contact us on support@coinxpad.io. You can find the IDO project wallet address from the CoinxPad project details page. Is my investment safe? All the projects launched on CoinxPad will be vetted and audited to ensure CoinxPad investors are safe against scams and rugs. As an investor, you need to make sure you thoroughly understand the project that you will be investing and do all the required research and only invest when you are confident. CoinxPad will not give you any financial advice or force you to invest in any projects. In crypto space, a general rule is, you can invest what you can afford to lose. CoinxPad is where you get access to the best new tokens before they list on other centralized or decentralized exchanges.
