Schedule a Demo Schedule a Demo Common Questions What is an Energy Attribute Certificate? An Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC) is a tradeable asset that carries the social and environmental attributes of electrical energy. Electricity grids can measure the amount of energy that generators put on to a grid and the amount that consumers take off; however it cannot measure the ‚Äòattributes‚Äô of that energy. EACs exist to track those attributes, who generates them, and who consumes them.&nbsp; Read more of the EPA. How are Energy Attribute Certificates made? In most countries, whenever a generator (solar farm, wind turbine, etc) generates a MWh of electrical energy it is entitled to a REC issued by their grid operator.&nbsp; How are Energy Attribute Certificates used? EACs are used by state/federal regulators to monitor compliance with Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) mandates. They are also used by companies to back consumer-facing and investor-facing environmental claims. What is an Renewable Energy Certificate? In the US, Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) are most often referred to as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). Read more from the EPA. Are EACs securities?&nbsp; No. In the US, Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) are regulated as ‚Äúnon-financial commodities.‚Äù See this journal article or this non-profit report for a more in-depth analysis. Can anyone buy/sell/own EACs? Yes. Anyone who generates renewable electricity (including with rooftop solar) can generate and sell EACs. Anyone can also buy and retire EACs for their personal energy consumption. Not Legal, Tax, or Investment Advice.
