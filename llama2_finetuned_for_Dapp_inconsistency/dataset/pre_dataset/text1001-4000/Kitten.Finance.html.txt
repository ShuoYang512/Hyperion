When you stake kBASEv0 into pool 203, it will be automatically converted to nkB (norm-kBASEv0), which is "the amount of kBASEv0 you will have if the total supply of kBASEv0 is 1M", and hence unaffected by rebases.And the amount of nkB is different from the amount of kBASEv0, because the total supply of kBASEv0 is different from 1M.When you unstake nkB, it will be automatically converted back to kBASEv0. An example: [assume kB total supply = 3M] =&gt; [you deposit 3000 kB, and becomes 1000 nkB] =&gt; [kB rebased to 4M total supply, and nkB is unaffected] =&gt; [however if you unstake 1000 nkB now, it becomes 4000 kB]. Hence your kB is rebased correctly.

The pools are for distributing tokens for AlphaDex &amp; KittenSwap. You can download MetaMask app to use Kitten.finance on mobile devices. You are still earning Uniswap LP fees (0.30%) when staking your LP in KF pools. Because your LP shares appreciate over time (Uniswap collects fees for you). The first deposit to a pool needs an "approval" tx. Wait for it to confirm, then refresh the page to stake to the pool. You can directly trade KIF using WETH, or provide KIF+WETH liquidity on UniSwap. This actually saves gas. So there's no need to unwrap WETH. Remember to leave some ETH for paying gas. NEVER set a high "slippage tolerance %" when trading on Uniswap, or bots will frontrun you. Better use 0.2% slippage and high gas, and split large buy orders into multiple smaller orders. Click the top-right button in Uniswap to set slippage. That 0.x% is the extra slippage that can occur if someone frontruns you.So if you set the slippage tolerance too high, bots will be happy to do that. Safety Advices: Buy a Macbook (or air) or Chromebook. Erase the HD. Install nothing except Chrome &amp; Metamask. Generate new addresses. Use it only for Kitten.Finance &amp; MetaMask. There shall never be another "approval" tx after you approved a pool for the first time. Otherwise it means the frontend is hacked or modified, and you are staking to the hacker's contract. For extra safety, use a Ledger for MetaMask. Total üê± KIF supply = 42000 [contract] [uniswap] [chart 1] [chart 2] [coingecko] No presale. No premine. All distributed by fair pools.
