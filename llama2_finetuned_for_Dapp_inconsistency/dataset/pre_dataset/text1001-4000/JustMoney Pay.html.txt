In the journey to become a mature Ecosystem on TRON Blockchain the support of the JM team has been instrumental and with JustMoney Pay our dream has finally come true and more. Not only is it possible to pay with $turu, but with all tokens listed in the JM Dex. This means that most projects we listed are able to offer Merchandise for sale to be paid for in their native coin.
