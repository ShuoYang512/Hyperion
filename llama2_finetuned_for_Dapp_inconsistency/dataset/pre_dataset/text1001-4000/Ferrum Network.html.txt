Launch App <!--Runtime Modification - Img tag is Still Available for SEO Goals in Source - --> A NEW ERA OF INTERCONNECTED BLOCKCHAINS PIONEERING INTEROPERABILITY 2.O THE PROBLEMINTEROPERABILITY 1.0 IS NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRY Blockchains are siloed and aren’t designed to communicate with each other. For developers, it’s nearly impossible to build multichain DApps. Furthermore, users are limited to single ecosystems and subject to the risks associated with crosschain bridging. SOLUTIONTHE FUTURE OF INTEROPERABILITY IS BRIDGELESS Ferrum Network is an interoperable L1 network, powered by a multichain messaging engine designed to communicate and connect with every blockchain, enabling a frictionless environment for developers to deploy multichain DApps and for users to engage in a fully interoperable Web 3.0. FERRUM’S INFINITY LAYER MAINNET LEVERAGES THE POLKADOT SUBSTRATE INFRASTRUCTURE Introducing Ferrum’s Infinity Layer mainnet: an interoperable L1 powered by a multichain messaging engine, which leverages the renowned Polkadot Substrate consensus infrastructure.

TECHNOLOGY POWERING INTEROPERABILITY 2.0 Many unique technologies are combined to create the Infinity Layer mainnet: a multichain execution layer powered by an atomic messaging engine known as Quantum Portal QUANTUM PORTAL Quantum Portal core and its related smart contracts with programmable interfaces maintain the state of value and information across blockchains.This powerful technology enables the build once, deploy everywhere functionality throughout our network’s connected chains. VALUE CONSTRAINEDMULTI CHAIN ROLLUPS Value Constrained Multi Chain Rollups taps into the L1 security much like the ZK and Optimistic rollup, but it can support multiple L1s and is not limited to Ethereum. VCPR enables Ferrum’s blockchains to become the L2 for many chains. MULTICHAIN VALIDATORSTAKING Multichain Validator Staking allows Ferrum’s blockchains to tap into native security mechanisms of each chain where transactions occur instead of relying on off-chain or secondary chain centralized staking. Staking happens on the chains where validation of transactions/information is required.
