It allows for high-throughput, low-cost trading and payment on Ethereum. Why Loopring? Secure Loopring is an open-sourced, audited, and non-custodial exchange and payment protocol. Nobody in the Loopring ecosystem needs to trust others. zkRollup assures assets are always under users' own control; 100% Ethereum-level security guarantees.
