 Home Music Visuals FAQ Merch Pandemica , or Timothy Stockton , is an electronic bass music producer, DJ, and visual artist from New Hampshire, USA. He started in 2013 and has since evolved his sound to focus on dubstep favoring deep talking basses and psychedelic themes. Member of Visionscape Records and Lost Space Records . "I discovered electronic music in high school and started producing shortly after graduation using FL Studio. I originally went by Pandemic and later changed my name to Pandemica in 2018 after joining the military, experiencing a music festival, and improving my skills. Next I learned how to DJ and played gigs at balls, bars and clubs. After the military I began my bachelors degree in computer science while continuing to perfect my craft. I began livestreaming, and soon found myself creating my own visuals using Blender. I am now married, a member of two labels, and working on my debut album (under a different, hopefully final, name). I'm only getting started." Working on the 'Level Up (Vol. 2)' EP, release date TBD. <!-- FIXME get endorsements back from them "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I'm genuinely excited to see him continue making moves in the industry!" -HngR "Pandemica's music, while reminiscent of early 2012 dubstep, brings a fresh twist through his combination of old FM synthesizers and hard-hitting modern synthesizers." -ZooKeeper "A huge team player, always giving quality feedback and support. If you want anyone to grow with during this musical journey, Pandemica is definitely one of them." -LUXSYNTH "Vocaloid basses, processed to perfection." -GOOGGZ Home Music Visuals FAQ Merch Copyright Â© 2018-2023 Timothy Stockton
