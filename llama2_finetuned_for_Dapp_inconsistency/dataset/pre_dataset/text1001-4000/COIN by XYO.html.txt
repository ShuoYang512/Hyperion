Launched in early 2019, COIN is a mobile app enabling over 5 million users to earn digital assets for validating geospatial location data when traveling, commuting, jogging or moving about the real world while interacting with each other and enjoying in-app challenges. Your Lifestyle, Your Rewards Where does it work? Earn COIN wherever you have GPS, Wifi, or Data connection. COIN App doesn’t use much cell data, so you can still binge Netflix or crush some candy without capping your monthly data limit. What can I earn? You can redeem the COIN you earn for physical or digital items. This ranges from Bluetooth speakers, to digital currencies you can sell on exchanges. It's your COIN, you decide! Why are you doing this? Tons of apps and products collect location data, but almost none of them give you rewards in exchange for your data. Stop earning nothing for your valuable data. Use COIN and earn what you deserve. Maximize COIN Rewards with eXtension Devices SentinelX BLE A sleek Bluetooth device with a replaceable battery.
