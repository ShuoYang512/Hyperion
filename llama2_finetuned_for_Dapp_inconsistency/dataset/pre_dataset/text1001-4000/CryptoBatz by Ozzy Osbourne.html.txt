Feast On The Flesh Of Other NFT"s We wanted CryptoBatz to do something new, something that wasn’t easy, something that we hadn’t seen before. EVERY CRYPTOBAT HOLDS an innovative power… THE ABILITY TO ‘BITE’ AN NFT FROM A DIFFERENT BLUE CHIP PROJECT and CREATE A ‘MUTANTBAT’ THAT SHARES THE DNA OF BOTH tokens. Every CryptoBat can bite ONCE and ONCE ONLY, so choose carefully, as What you choose to bite will dictate which MutantBat you create. to bite from a selection of blue chip ‘victim’ projects, You must hold both the CryptoBat and the victim both in the same wallet. Biting utility will open up soon after public mint (exact date TBD). Below is a list of ‘Victim Projects’ that your CryptoBatz will be able to ‘BITE’: BAYC / CrypToadz / SupDucks / Alien Frens / CyberKongz Dark Creatures With A Golden Ratio Every CryptoBat trait has been creatively directed by Ozzy Osbourne. Unlike some of Ozzy’s previous bat friends, these ones live safely in the metaverse and are not edible… yet. But we went even further… to achieve the perfect composition, we followed THE FIBONACCI SEQUENCE (ALSO KNOWN AS THE GOLDEN RATIO) making CryptoBatz artwork oddly pleasing to the eye and beautiful enough that you could hang on the wall next to that photo of grandma.
