CoreCard is an identity level NFT in the Coresky ecosystem, which implements a decentralized identity governance system. Minting and binding CoreCard allows one to become a member of the Coresky community and enjoy various benefits provided by the platform, including participating in Coresky Launchpad.Holders can obtain tickets by binding their CoreCards on the Coresky platform and use them to participate in lottery draws on Coresky Launchpad. Winners will be granted the right to cast Launchpad's Asset-packaged NFTs. How many levels does CoreCard have? CoreCard is divided into six levels of equity, ranging from level 0 to level 5. These levels are respectively called: CoreCardV0 Kite, CoreCardV1 Balloon, CoreCardV2 Biplane, CoreCardV3 Jet, CoreCardV4 Satellite, and CoreCardV5 Spacecraft. What are the differences between different levels of CoreCard Different levels of CoreCard will generate varying numbers of tickets on a weekly basis. Users who hold higher levels of CoreCard will receive more ticket deposits than those with lower levels. Please note that users are able to mint multiple CoreCards but can only select one for binding operation at a time. CoreCard Upgrade Rules Users can increase their CoreCard level by burning Coresky points or completing other tasks set by the platform. Participating in Coresky transaction mining activities is one way to obtain Coresky points. When users make NFT transactions on the Coresky Marketplace, they will receive a certain amount of Coresky points as a reward.The Coresky pool provides 5 million Coresky points per period. These points will be exchanged with the platform token at a certain ratio after the platform token goes online. Users can earn Coresky points based on their transaction volume on the Coresky platform (transaction mining does not include aggregate orders from Opensea).The Coresky point reward formula is as follows:Seller reward: EBuyer reward: FNumber of points received by the seller: A = C × ENumber of points received by the buyer: B = D × FIn the formula, C represents the seller's transaction amount (measured in ETH), and D represents the buyer's transaction amount (measured in ETH). In this period's Coresky transaction mining activity, the seller reward E is 59.04 points, and the buyer reward F is 25.30 points.For example, if two users make an NFT transaction of 0.5 ETH on the Coresky platform, the seller will receive 29.52 points, and the buyer will receive 12.65 points. If a user trades 1 ETH on Coresky, the seller will receive 59.04 points, and the buyer will receive 25.30 points.The reward points for a single user are unlimited, but the minimum reward points are 0.0001 points. When the 5 million Coresky points in the current period's pool are mined out, the next transaction mining activity will begin. As the number of CoreCard holders increases, the yield of each round's pool will decrease appropriately, and mining difficulty will gradually increase.
