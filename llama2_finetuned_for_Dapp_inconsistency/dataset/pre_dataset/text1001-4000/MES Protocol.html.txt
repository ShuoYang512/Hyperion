Together with a Data Availability Committee (DAC), MES is 100% decentralized and permissionless, while maintaining full scalability.PROMES Spot | LITEMES Convert | Frequently Asked QuestionsCan't find an answer to your question? Reach out to us at Discord.What is MES Protocol?MES Protocol aims to tackle the liquidity fragmentation problem on L2s by building a liquidity layer across popular rollups, so users can trade any tokens across any chains.What is ZK rollup?ZK rollup refers to zero-knowledge rollup. It is a layer 2 scaling solution that uses validity proofs to scale computation: each batch of transactions comes with a cryptographic proof (ZK-SNARK) that is verified by an Ethereum smart contract. This way every single transaction is fully verified by all Ethereum full nodes before a block is finalized. Thus, it enjoys high transaction execution speed, whilst inheriting Ethereum's security level. Does MES have a token?No! We don't have an official token yet. So don't be scammed by the fake MES tokens out there.Do you have a plan to fully decentralize MES someday?Yes! Decentralization has always been at the heart of our core values. Right now we are operating on a validum model, and with the introduction of Data Availability Commmittee (DAC) in the future, MES will progressively attain a greater degree of decentralization.How do I give feedbacks?Make sure you joined our discord channel which we will be actively answering questions from our community!
