 Emiswap DEX Sunset: A Journey Towards New Horizons In light of the intense competition and challenges in the cryptocurrency market, we have decided to make a strategic pivot by decommissioning EmiSwap DEX and investing our resources and expertise in developing new products that will deliver value and profitability to our investors and the community at large. This shift in focus will ensure that we are able to adapt to the evolving market conditions and capitalize on emerging opportunities, ultimately securing a strong return on investment for our stakeholders. As part of this transition, we have temporarily suspended token balances and conducted a token balance snapshot. These tokens can be retrieved by contacting token_request@emiswap.com . Investors and advisors who were allocated tokens on the platform but have not yet claimed them can also request their tokens through this channel. It is crucial to emphasize that all issued tokens reflect each community member's contribution to the project, and this will not be forgotten. Don't let your tokens go unclaimed. Additionally, smart contract addresses for all pairs will be published. If you have unclaimed funds, you will be able to retrieve them from the contracts using MetaMask or a similar wallet. By leveraging our knowledge and experience in the sector, we will develop cutting-edge solutions that address the needs of the market while maintaining a strong emphasis on transparency, security, and user-friendliness. Our team of seasoned professionals is dedicated to driving innovation and delivering exceptional results, with a commitment to continuous improvement and growth. As we embark on this exciting new journey, we invite you to join us in realizing our vision for a more prosperous and sustainable future. Together, we can unlock the full potential of our collective expertise and create products that stand out in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. Your support and partnership will be instrumental in helping us achieve our ambitious goals and contribute to the long-term success of our endeavor. We firmly believe that with your backing and our unwavering dedication, we can make a significant and lasting impact in the industry, ensuring a bright future for our investors, community, and the broader ecosystem. Regards, your EmiSwap team
