 Onboarding the next billion users to web3 by destroying blockchain segregation A secure, scalable, modular, composable framework for cross-chain interoperability Enter Phase 1 of Gamified Testnet Mandara Join Community There are 30+ blockchains with their own communities and Dapps But bridges get hacked, and the Information between them transmits slowly Lack of secure interoperability limits the web3 ecosystem growth because of: Fragmented Liquidity Different chains can’t share liquidity, resulting in lower liquidity in every chain Collaboration Limits It’s hard to collaborate and share communities between networks, resulting in small segregated communities Security Breaches Existing bridges are not secure and decentralized, and they get hacked often, resulting in low trust in the ecosystem With router protocol, different blockchains can finally understand each other Router protocol is a layer 1 chain, that connects different blockchains Enter Phase 1 of Gamified Testnet Mandara You can swap assets, send messages, and build iDapps across multiple Chains Ethereum Polygon BSC Avalanche Fantom Aurora Kava Base Arbitrum Rootstock Moonbeam Moonriver If you are a Conventional suit, you can build some boring stuff Cross Chain Yield AggregatorCross Chain Lending ProtocolCross Chain NFT Marketplace You can earn yield on hundreds of chains, however there is no way to manage all of the yield protocols on all of the chains from one place. You have a chance to solve this problem by creating the first secure cross-chain yield aggregatorPeople can lend and borrow only on isolated chains. Why??? Because they don’t know that on router you can create a product, that allows you to lend and borrow across many chains. Use this to your advantage and make a profitdegens love NFTs. There are many isolated NFT communities from different chains.

If any of the transactions fails, the proxy contract will revertCross-chain Meta Transactions enable gasless cross-chain transactions for the end users by delegating the execution of a cross-chain request to a third-party serviceMetamask compatibility Unlike most chains built using tendermint, the Router chain will have full-fledged support for MetaMask, one of the most popular crypto walletsExpiry Timestamp users can send an expiry timestamp with each cross-chain request, which determines the latest timestamp by which a cross-chain transaction should be executedRefund system send extra gas limit as a buffer, with the assurance of automatic refunds for an excess feeModular Security Applications can implement their own security measures on top of the baseline security model provided by the Router ChainInfra-level flexibility Depending on your requirements, you can build cross-chain applications using the Router’s stateful infra or stateless infra Read The Docs to Learn More Check how easy it is to go cross-chain yourself Read the docs to learn more See how Router works with Voyager - cross-chain asset swap Swap 100+ tokens on 20+ chains in seconds Open Voyager App Powered by $ROUTE token ROUTE is a transferable representation of a functional asset that will be used as the gas and governance token in the Router ecosystem.
