The game blends mechanics from massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) and web3-enabled virtual worlds. Think of it as a metaRPG where the players own the world, your NFTs can become playable characters, and thousands can play together in real time.Leave Your MarkFirst to the futureOur mission is to make Otherside immersive, interactive, and collaborative in a way that’s never been done before. So in the spirit of Dungeons and Dragons, Otherside will be an always-evolving experience co-created with its players. With an Otherdeed, you can participate in prototype builds, demos, and tests that shape the final game design and experience.Building the future is a team effort — and we want you to be part of our team.Own a pieceYOUR OTHERDEED AWAITSBuild on the Otherside, collect resources, create and play on it, and make yourself at home.

With the power of Improbable’s M2 technology, 10,000+ players will be able to interact simultaneously in a single place, connect with natural voice chat (even in crowds of thousands), experience rich, immersive gameplay supported by AI and physics, and move between metaverses. Otherside players will break through barriers in scale, bandwidth, and rendering as they create new types of gameplay and social possibilities.Just like processing power in your PC can limit the quality of a game’s graphics, metaverses are limited in their scale by how many communication operations or ‘ops’ per second they can process. Typical online game worlds can handle around 10,000 operations per second. Otherside will be able to handle more than half a billion operations per second, which will power new gameplay and interactions never before possible at an unprecedented scale.It’ll also solve problems in bandwidth and rendering, using machine learning to allow huge crowds to all look different, allowing you and everybody else to bring your own external NFT character to Otherside.10,000+ players10,000+ people interacting simultaneously in a single locationSpeak up togetherIn-world natural voice chat for thousands (making it easier to hear those you are facing)Physics x AIMillions of complex, interactive entities in a single world supported with physics and AINext level socialIncredible live interaction between playersSee you on the OthersideBuy OtherdeedClaim OtherdeedYuga LabsImprobableAnimoca© 2023 Yuga Labs Inc.FAQsTerms &amp; conditionsPrivacyLicenseNFT Purchase AgreementTwitterDiscordYoutube
