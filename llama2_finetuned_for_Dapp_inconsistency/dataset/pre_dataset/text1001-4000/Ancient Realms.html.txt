There are 2 types of tools; Fishing Rods and Pickaxes. Fishing earns you FISH which heals you, while a pickaxe earns IRON for repairing your gear. COMBAT Equip your weapon and armor NFT's to increase your gearscore! The higher your gearscore, the stronger monster's you'll be able to take on.

BOSSES and DROPS Each region of the map has it's own boss that can drop unique NFT's that have powerful stats. You will not only need a high gearscore, but you will also need to pay a fee in GOLD to access the region boss. Distinguished members of their regions, a Boss is a fierce fighter that will deal significant damage to your armor and health, costing FISH and IRON to replenish.
