Plastic does not biodegrade, but instead fragments into smaller and smaller particles, culminating in microplastics. Microplastics, which are less than 5mm in size, make up a large portion of the hundreds of millions of tons of plastic debris in our seas. The effects of marine pollution do not end with aquatic life, as we ingest some of these sea creatures.
