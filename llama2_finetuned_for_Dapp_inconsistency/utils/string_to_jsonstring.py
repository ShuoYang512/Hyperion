Introduction 
Vision  
Yield
Empire Capital Token allows users to earn a yield on their crypto assets through staking and farming by holding a 
single asset - ECC. DeFi(Decentralized Finance) is constantly evolving. Most investors entering the DeFi space either 
don’t have the time to properly manage a portfolio of yield farming strategies or struggle to navigate all the steps 
required to participate. Empire Capital provides an effective solution and removes the need for active management 
by the user. Empire Capital is the easy button for DeFi investing. 
Build
Cryptocurrency is ever-evolving, and the technology and use-case are advancing rapidly. Empire Capital looks to 
capitalize on its innovative technology and other project ventures whose ideas could change the landscape as we 
know it. Empire Capital is contracting out its developers to help build third-party projects by offering infrastructure 
services. Empire Capital receives time-locked investments into ECC in return for developmental services. These ser-
vices benefit the Empire Capitals community and partners in addition to spreading awareness as a helping hand in 
shaping the future of cryptocurrency. 
Bridge
Empire Capital looks to bring forth a new era where all cryptocurrency and fiat are easily interchangeable and read-
ily available. Empire Capital believes its Rounding Up App - Roundify - will be a bridge from CeFi to DeFi and act as 
a DeFi normalization stepping stone to the vision Empire Capital hopes to achieve. Roundify will allow investors entry 
into ECC and other crypto-index funds without navigating the many steps it takes to participate as it is now. In addi-
tion, Roundify will be informative regarding innovative cryptocurrency projects on the market, and most importantly, it 
will provide easy access for CeFi investors to DeFi Projects. Empire Capital is not only a FaaS DeFi project; it is a team 
of builders and innovators diversifying yields within and well beyond DeFi. 
Empire Capital is not only a FaaS DeFi project, it is a team of builders and innovators diversifying yields within and 
beyond DeFi. The services offered is at a minimum three-fold; providing management of high yield DeFi assets for our 
users, providing cross-chain infrastructure and developmental support for new cryptocurrency innovators looking to 
implement products within the DeFi space, and pioneering the seamless connection between everyday CeFi investors 
and the DeFi ecosystem.
Mission
Since our inception, our mission has been to simplify investing and building Decentralized Finance projects while 
making it universally accessible and beneficial. Today, people turn to Empire Capital for peace of mind when look-
ing for developmental support or to invest. We are grateful to offer such services. As the cryptocurrency landscape 
continues to advance, we will stay adaptive and committed to maintaininvg an exceptional level of support.
 
2.01 Tokenomics 
On each purchase of ECC, there is a 10% fee. 9% of the buy fee is distributed amongst the existing 
holders according to their ECC amount. 1% is removed from existence, as Empire Capital’s burn 
mechanism results in a proper burn. The vast majority of “tax tokens” offer a burn function in their con-
tract, which sends “burned” tokens to a “dead-wallet” or “black-hole wallet” as their deflation meth-
od. These burn methods do not affect the total supply, and the burn wallets end up stealing yield/
reflections from actual holders. By implementing a true 1% burn on every buy, ECC’s total supply 
will constantly deflate while your balance continuously increases against an ever-deflating supply. 
These tokenomics create a proper supply-and-demand metric for ECC as it becomes increasingly 
scarce with volume.

assets as part of treasury 
On each sell/transfer of $ECC, there is a 10% fee. 4% is allocated to the ECC treasury, where funds are issued 
to invest or farm in projects to increase the value of the treasury portfolio. Moreover, Empire Capital may issue 
treasury funds to purchase ECC tokens to be burned, thus raising the price floor while lowering the total supply. 
In addition, 4% of each sell will be allocated to a marketing wallet for advertising across mainstream and social 
media to spread awareness about Empire Capital and the services provided. Finally, 2% of each sell will be added 
to liquidity, as it is essential and beneficial to the stability of ECC that a healthy amount of liquidity is maintained to 
promote longevity and a less volatile chart. Greater liquidity enables larger purchases or sells of ECC, enabling 
large-capital backers to invest in the token more effectively.
Maximum Supply: 100,000,000 ECC
10% Buy Fee
9% of each buy goes to existing holders.
1% of each buy is burned from the supply forever.
10% Sell/Transfer fee
4% of each sell goes into the treasury fund which will then go into multi-chain farming or to buyback ECC tokens.
4% of each sell goes into marketing ECC to bring more awareness into Empire Capital ecosystem.
2% of each sell goes into is used to create more liquidity (ECC/BNB LP).
Supply Supply decreases with Demand
Demand
We have implemented a true 1% burn on every buy so that our total supply will constantly be deflating around your 
balance while your balance is constantly increasing against an ever-deflating supply. Creating a true supply/de-
mand metric to the ECC token as it becomes ever so scarce with volume.
2.03 Governance
Voting
ECC holders will be able to make proposals on strategies and vote on these proposals. 1 ECC will 
equal to1 voting point. There is a minimum requirement of holding 150,000 ECC to make a proposal.
1 ECC = 1 Voting point

DeFi - CeFi
ECC/Sanem Digital’s Cefi - Defi 
RUA (Rounding Up App)
Empire Capital has gone a step further in diversifying potential yields by beginning to examine traditional finance 
strategies as a registered corporation in New Zealand. Empire Capital LTD has partnered with Sanem Digital, direct-
ed by Michael Moran, an ex-Deloitte alumnus, and partner. Under the expertise of Michael Moran, Empire Capital 
LTD will use treasury funds combined with angel funds to invest in CeFi(Centralized/Traditional Finance) startups, 
private sales, IPOs, etc. 
The vast majority of people in the world have not participated in cryptocurrencies. More often than not, this results 
from the barriers presented to new investors when first entering the world of DeFi. Empire Capital aims to be the ac-
cess point for new users to enter the decentralized world. The main problem many hesitant investors face with cryp-
tocurrencies is the lack of accessibility. Empire Capital and Sanem Digital have begun bridging the gap by creating 
a Roundify to offer a more efficient entry point into DeFi from fiat.
Introducing Roundify
To appeal to those unfamiliar with the necessary steps to partake in DeFi, we must offer a product that provides easier 
access to its ecosystem in order to bridge the gap between DeFi and CeFi. Roundify is a Round-Up application that 
uses open banking technology to allow a round-up of transactions to be swept into crypto investments on a pre-con-
figured cadence, e.g., daily, weekly, monthly. For example, a user would link their bank account to Roundify, and if a 
purchase was made for $2.80 for a cup of coffee, the app would Round-Up the purchase to $3.00, and that remain-
ing $.20 would then be invested into a DeFi project such as ECC. The user configures the round-ups as the nearest 
dollar, 5 dollars or 10 dollars, etc. In addition, there are other investment features such as one-off transactions within 
pre-configured limits. For example, instead of buying cigarettes, a user can invest a one-off sum to see the benefits of 
quitting a bad habit; and make Regular payments the day after payday, etc. The app will also include a dashboard 
display of investments to track progress.
The benefits of Roundify are ever-expanding for ECC, DeFi, and users alike. The Roundify acts as a crypto shortcut for 
fiat investors and crypto novices while increasing the normalcy of DeFi cryptocurrencies as a whole. Specifically for 
ECC, the benefits include; increased buying pressure, reduced friction for the community by simplifying investing fiat 
into ECC, validation as the primary partner for the app with an outsized say in the development roadmap, and the 
managing the curation of partners who will have access to this technology. Roundify will be available in the Apple 
and Android stores.
How does Roundify fit into Empire Capitals partner Sanem Digital’s existing product ecosystem? Sanem Digital has 
several proprietary platforms, including a member-only travel booking platform. Since Sanem Digital has developed 
Roundify, the functionality has been designed for future releases to allow users to earn travel dollars which can be 
used on hotels using the Sanem Digital travel platform.
How does RUA fit into Sanem Digital’s existing product ecosystem?
Sanem Digital has a number of proprietary platforms which includes a member only travel booking platform. As RUA 
has been developed by the Sanem Digital team, functionality has been designed for future release to allow users of 
the RUA app to earn travel dollars which can be spent on hotels using the Sanem Digital travel platform. 
IaaS
Infrastructure-as-a-service
Empire Capital provides Infrastructure-as-a-Service to third-party organizations in need of developmental support 
for their project expansion. Services include cross-chain bridges, farming infrastructure, token/NFT contract services, 
presale/launchpad, dashboard services, backend API/metadata services, graphics, cross-chain reflections bridge, 
and white-labeling services. Empire Capital’s development and infrastructure services support eight different chains 
and prides itself on providing solutions to complex problems.
Empire Capital’s Infrastructure-as-a-Service offers an easy-access infrastructure hub for developers and users. The 
requirement for Empire Capital’s IaaS is a time-locked investment into Empire Capital Token, ECC. Empire Capital 
shows dedication to its community and third-party organizations by asking for investment into ECC in lieu of direct 
payment to the development team and acts in the best interest of all parties involved. Third parties receive the devel-
opment support they require while ECC community members benefit from raised price floor due to the time-locked 
investment. Offering such services works to bring not only attention to ECC, but also brings a new source of revenue 
streams that will flow back into the ECC ecosystem.
Infrastructure-as-a-Service is advantageous to third-party organizations and ECC holders alike; Empire Capital 
builds its development reputation, third-party organizations receive the assistance they need, and the Empire Capital 
community members benefit from the time-locked investment into ECC. It is crucial to the continued success of ECC 
that Empire Capital strives to be the frontline producer on all blockchains.
