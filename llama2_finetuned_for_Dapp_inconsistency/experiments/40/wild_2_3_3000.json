Media Gallery Enjoy our work-in-progress screenshots from the world of Ember Sword. Go to gallery Nations Astronomers, scholars and deep flux-grown woods as far as the eye can see. With an academy at the center of it all, Solarwood holds many secrets. As the best minds of Thanabus seek knowledge, they may just find more than they bargained for. The anomaly that brought life to Thanabus offered its greatest bounty to Solarwood, as its lush forests grew and grew out of nothing, covering the northern hemisphere of the moon. The forests arent the only point of interest in Solarwood, as ancient structures from before the Catastrophe remain scattered throughout, the perfect lure for Burkhalter Academys scholars… Does a jungle beckon you - a wilderness of alien beasts and carnivorous fauna? If so, unite with the fellow dispossessed of Sevrend and make your stand against the Republic. During the Catastrophe, the lush jungle was devastated. The most extreme impact points were marked by deep fissures and jagged borders. Fumes carrying toxics and radiation bathed the landscape. The Catastrophe splits Thanabus into fragments, creating jagged cliffs and bottomless fissures spewing chartreuse flames. Where the jungle has regrown, vines hug the surfaces of alien rocks. Would you escape to the desert, where traders and scavengers vicariously maneuver between rampant automatons and unholy beasts? Duskeron calls. Following the destruction of Starzhen, a horrific dust storm swept across Thanabus. Winds carried the storm to the arid lands of Duskeron, burying the sophisticated technology under its desert visage. The dry land of Duskeron is a harsh bastion of scavengers and traders, extending over an entire quarter of Thanabus. The frigid tundra of Ediseau holds the seat of power for the Republic's undisputed rule over the northern hemisphere of the moon. Is this where you belong? After the Catastrophe fragments from the aftermath entered Thanabus atmosphere and showered the world in destruction. Fragments cut through and plummeted into the civilization below. Once a humid forest, Ediseau is now a snowy frontier, with a cold atmosphere that permeates to the bone. Half the trees died to the new climate, leaving an arctic tundra bordering a white forest. Solarwood Sevrend Duskeron Ediseau Solarwood Sevrend Duskeron Ediseau Explore Solarwood Ownership Economy True Ownership We believe that players should be able to earn real value for their time invested in the game. This truly player-owned ecosystem puts the player in control of what happens to these cosmetics and what they want to do with them. Keep them? Trade them? Sell them? The choice is yours. Regular Plot 1 1 Do you aspire to earn the title of a Sir or a Lady? If so, you can easily get your hands on any number of Regular Plots of land in Solarwood. This land is perfect for those players who want to share in the rewards but want to put less time into land ownership.

You will also be able to give players quests. With all these attractions, you will be well rewarded with a multiplier of 10x per plot for your share of the trading in Ember Sword.

Send us a message What is Interport? Interport is a decentralized cross-chain exchange (DEX) that enables users to seamlessly swap assets across multiple blockchain networks without the need for intermediaries. It aggregates the best rates from various liquidity providers and offers an efficient and user-friendly trading experience. Is Interport safe to use? Yes, Interport is built on secure and audited smart contracts, ensuring the safety of users' funds. However, like any decentralized platform, it's crucial for users to take appropriate security measures, such as using trusted wallets and keeping private keys secure. Does Interport offer the best rates? Interport aims to provide the most competitive rates by aggregating liquidity from multiple sources and accounting for factors like gas fees and slippage. This enables users to obtain optimal trading rates for their cross-chain swaps. What are cross-chain swaps? Cross-chain swaps allow users to exchange assets between different blockchain networks. This process involves the transfer of one asset on a source chain to a corresponding asset on a destination chain, without the need for centralized intermediaries. Can I perform single-chain swaps on Interport? Yes, Interport supports single-chain swaps in addition to cross-chain swaps. Users can easily swap assets within the same blockchain network, leveraging the platform's aggregated liquidity and competitive rates. What if my transaction failed/reverted? There are a few reasons why transactions may fail which do not depend on us, such as blockchain errors, low slippage, gas limitations, etc. However, with Interport, you can be sure that your assets are safe. Just withdraw you assets on Assets Refund page.

Borrow Now Borrow Now FAQ ALL QUESTIONS ALL QUESTIONS What is Olympus? The Olympus protocol is a decentralized financial (DeFi) system that supports OHM, a treasury backed, liquidity-enabling token on the Ethereum network. Olympus leverages the mechanisms of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL), Range Bound Stability (RBS) and Cooler Loans to create a robust, flexible, censorship-resistant, and smart money. What is the goal of Olympus? The goal of Olympus is to build a programmatic policy-controlled money that: — Preserves purchasing power via long-term price predictability — Maintains reliable liquidity across decentralized exchanges — Is used as a unit of account (e.g., by being paired against many other decentralized assets) — Is utilized as a trusted asset (e.g., to collateralize other assets or deposited into protocols treasuries). — Is fully decentralized and controlled by the community — Is financially flexible, allowing users to borrow the backing against their money Why do we need Olympus in the first place? Fiat-pegged stablecoins have become an essential part of crypto due to their lack of volatility as compared to tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether. Users are comfortable with transacting stablecoins knowing they hold the same amount of purchasing power today vs. tomorrow. Unfortunately, this is a fallacy. Fiat dollars are controlled by centralized government monetary policy and always decrease in purchasing power (inflation). This depreciation of the dollar also means a depreciation of these stablecoins. Olympus solves Web3s reliance on centralized, censorable stablecoin assets by supporting OHM, a free-floating, community-governed money that is backed by a growing treasury. Is OHM a stablecoin? No, OHM is in the “flatcoin” category. OHM is a free-floating money that is subject to the Range Bound Stability (RBS) system. It programmatically and transparently encourages a price range for market participants. Is OHM pegged? Unlike stablecoins, OHM is not pegged to any fiat currency. Instead, it is backed by a growing $200M+ worth of assets in the Olympus Treasury, ensuring confidence and stability via the RBS monetary policy. Learn more about RBS.

Through staking PERL, PerlinX users can supply liquidity while simultaneously earning rewards. Collateralize and Create Synthetic Assets PerlinX will be the interface for the creation of synthetic assets of any kind. PERL will be the sole collateral asset for this process. The mechanisms needed to perform this function will be implemented into PerlinX very soon. Frequently Asked Questions What does PERL do? PERL functions as both a liquidity asset and a collateralization asset. You can stake your PERL to earn incentives and over-collateralize your PERL to create synthetic (px) assets, eg. pxOil, pxCarbon, pxGold Read more about this in our User Guide. What are the incentives for Liquidity Providers (LPs)? A liquidity incentive program will be announced shortly after PerlinX is launched to drive the formation of deep initial liquidity and is a stepping stone towards designing an effective long-term mechanism to incentivize LPs Discuss future incentive programs with the Perlin team and community in our Discord. When will I be able to generate synthetic assets on PerlinX? The team is in the final stages of implementing the mechanisms needed to generate synthetic assets using the PerlinX interface. This will be launched in the coming weeks and is the team's #1 priority. What's the roadmap for the rest of 2020? The future of PerlinX will be to narrow the gap between global legacy markets and DeFi, with more support for commodities and digital assets, as well as potentially more complex assets and financial products (pending regulatory approval). In addition, the team will look into improving the underlying AMM and synthetic asset minting process to enhance capital efficiency, such as adding liquidity-sensitive fees, and using liquidity pool tokens to collateralise debt.

Liquid Staking Innovative liquid staking token that accrues while using an increasing exchange rate, rather than rebasing which is better for DeFi and better for tax reporting. Smart Contracts Open source, audited smart contracts ensure funds are never in the custody of node operators. Smart Nodes With our custom node software any user/business/group can run a node on our network, stake their own ETH for free and generate a higher return. Minimised Penalty Risk Any losses that occur from bad nodes for stakers who deposit ETH are socialised across the whole network to minimise impacts on any single user. Infrastructure Network redundancy and decentralisation are key pillars of the Rocket Pool network. Any potential issues and their effects are minimised using this technique.

We manually add certain pairs and enable our scary model which is a way to reward users indirectly from the pair instead of rewarding liquidity providers from swapping fees , we offer rewards from investing your staked tokens into other farming pools protocols like Binance , Bifi , YieldWolf etc the scary model helps us maintain liquidity for our zero fees pairs without the need of new liquidity providers coming in , making the liquidity for each pair constantly growing.

Stader is a non-custodial, smart contract-driven staking platform that facilitates easy discovery and utilization of staking solutions. It acts as an essential staking middleware infrastructure for various Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks, catering to retail cryptocurrency users, exchanges, and custodians. What is liquid staking? Liquid staking is a mechanism within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space that allows users to stake their cryptocurrency to earn rewards while retaining liquidity of the staked assets. Unlike traditional staking, where the staked funds are locked and inaccessible for a defined period, liquid staking provides a tokenized version of the staked assets. This means users can still buy, sell, trade, or use those assets, making them more flexible and convenient. Liquid staking offers the dual benefit of better rewards through staking and the ability to continue utilizing the staked funds in other DeFi opportunities. What are the benefits of liquid staking? Staking rewards: Liquid staking enables you to get auto-compounded rewards from staking your crypto tokens anytime. Enhanced liquidity: You can access staking rewards anytime by converting your tokens into liquid tokens, avoiding lock-up periods. You can freely trade or use these liquid tokens in DeFi protocols and unlock additional rewards on top of staking rewards. Liquid staking is a great option to enjoy flexibility and get staking rewards without locking up your tokens.View more Know more about Liquid Staking with Stader Labs Liquid Staking Platform | Earn Liquid Staking Rewards with Stader Liquid Staking Platforms: Powering the Future of Decentralized Finance [DeFi] Liquid Staking Platforms such as Staderlabs are powering the future of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by providing flexibility and accessibility.

Note: *The actual rewards may vary on different factors, including market conditions, staking duration, and stakes amount. The Future of Staking: Liquid or Traditional? Even though it is still very early for us to comment on what the future looks like for Staking, some believe that liquid staking will eventually be the majorly preferred form. In contrast, others believe that traditional staking will continue to be the most popular. Liquid Staking allows users to earn staking rewards without locking up their tokens. In contrast, in Traditional Staking, users have to lock their tokens for a set period of time to earn staking rewards, which can be inconvenient for users who want to use their tokens for other purposes. Here are some of the factors that will likely influence the future of staking: The growth of DeFi: Increased popularity of DeFi will likely lead to an increased demand for liquid staking, as users would want to use their staked tokens to participate in DeFi. The development of new liquid staking protocols: With the potential increase in the number of liquid staking protocols being developed, these protocols will likely make liquid staking more accessible and affordable, leading to an increase in the adoption of liquid staking. Overall, the future of staking looks bright. Liquid staking is gaining popularity, and it will likely continue to grow in the future. It remains to be looked at which staking method would be most preferred in the future. How Liquid Staking is Revolutionizing the Crypto Industry Liquid Staking is quickly gaining popularity in the crypto industry as it allows users to stake their tokens without having to lock them up for a set period of time, giving them more flexibility and access to liquidity. Liquid Staking is becoming a lucrative option for stakers who prefer to earn additional rewards while still being able to use their tokens for other DeFi activities. Liquid staking is still a relatively new technique but can potentially revolutionize how stakers participate in staking. With more liquid staking platforms and further technological advancement, Liquid Staking is likely to become the favorite staking method for many users. Some of the ways that Liquid Staking can be revolutionary for the Crypto Industry are: Increased liquidity: Liquid Staking can help stakers with the opportunity to participate in other DeFi activities by providing them liquidity while still being able to earn staking rewards. Increased participation in staking: Liquid staking promotes greater involvement for stakers by offering access to their token's value, even when their tokens are locked up for a specific duration. Liquid Staking could become a favored choice for stakers by delivering simultaneous liquidity and staking rewards. Flexibility: Liquid staking bestows users with the benefit of utilizing their tokens' value while still earning staking rewards.

How UMA works The Optimistic Oracle verifies data in stages 01 Statement A statement is proposed as true A natural-language statement is submitted along with a bond. The bond acts as a bounty for anyone to dispute it if they have evidence to the contrary. 02 Challenge period Most statements go undisputed Anyone can propose an answer to a data request, and it is accepted as true if it is not disputed during the challenge period. 03 Dispute Anyone can dispute a statement Each statement submitted for validation is an opportunity for anyone to earn a reward by disputing it successfully. As the game theory would predict, disputes are rare in practice because the incentives are always to be honest. That makes the OO “optimistic”. 04 Voting Tokenholders vote on disputes and earn rewards The UMA token provides economic guarantees to the Optimistic Oracle. The community of tokenholders provide the human component, as voters, for the OO's final resolution on disputes or queries. Those who vote with the majority earn rewards. Participate as a Voter Stake, vote & earn up to 30.1% APR Stake Stake your $UMA to help secure UMA's Optimistic Oracle. Vote Token holders who vote correctly and consistently earn higher APYs.

Nevertheless, many existing exchanges, which refer to themselves as decentralized, are not entirely so: they use their own servers to store information on trades and orders to buy or sell users' assets, but the private keys are kept by the users themselves. Decentralized exchanges need a distributed ledger to keep and deal with all information and provide the technical possibility of direct interaction between transaction participants.

They have no management with an interest in manipulating prices. They give complete anonymity to the user due to not storing user assets, so that neither hacker attacks nor a complete collapse of the exchange itself will threaten the loss of funds. They do not also have a single entry point through which all assets and data can be accessed, which makes it difficult for hackers and makes the attack itself pointless. Therefore, decentralized DEX exchanges give you full control over your own funds. Venera Swap presentations English Great Expectations If you are a determined, goal-oriented and successful person, with the help of DEX and Venera Swap you will definitely make your dreams true and the future results will meet your expectations for sure. In the niche of numerous products, it is very important to choose the right one and not get lost in many substandard things. It will lead you to the way to success and fill your life with unbelievable achievements. There is a nice Chinese proverb saying: ‘The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. It means that if you want success in the future, the best time to act is today.

Whitelist & Public sale Monthly Report - February Will Farmers World update or not? That's probably the question we've received the most in the past few months. We'll answer that, right now, by another question: when the update? However, we are living in special times. Real wars lead to currency wars.

Clashes The white tribes, as well as the red ones, have discovered the farms and are planning to conquer them. Aware of this potential threat, farmers now start to forge new weapons, recruit new warriors, and join forces to protect their farms against dangerous intruders. It appears that devastating conflicts are seemingly inevitable. Farmersworlds Ecosystem Players can easily switch resources between Farmersworld and other games. For example, players can bring their land and troops in other games to Farmersworld and vice versa. Farmers Land After mining gold, farmers will find ways to buy new land on which they build their farms. Company: G.JIT JAPAN Partnership Program: partners@farmersworld.io FOLLOW, ",

To create a positive loop, a team that's originally from Xiaomi decided to expand the investment in content production while choosing this track in the medium casual competitive category given the overall situation at the time (COVID-19). Hopefully, this will increase the viscosity of the platform and product users. The team also collaborated with Unity to develop the underlying framework of the product and designed a full set of Unity technology to realize the product planning. Unity provided all the technical support for the Puff project, and the best TA team in the world was brought in to realize the Puff products art and animation. The team created the base framework of the editor based on Unity to give the best action game experience to the users after it was introduced to the public. The typical single-character settings were abandoned in favor of a character set that emphasizes “Who I am” by letting the users choose from different characters. Each character has their own character traits — Everyone is born different, and everyone can confidently be their best self — There is always a role whose characteristic can be projected onto the individual player, triggering the maverick GenZ users' empathy for 'being brave and being yourself,' allowing them to accept and integrate into Puff's world. Characters Patty Claude Ashe Bill Duck Pop Vigorous, innocent, and pure dinosaur Patty A dinosaur hatched by a mysterious egg covered in green fuzz, with sharp claws and a chubby body. He saved the Princess when she was hunted and under siege by the Moru Evil Group. Somehow, he recognizes himself as her guardian angel, and always protects the Princess from any crisis because Princess is the first person he met after the incubation. However, he is actually the doppelganger of the Demon King who is in the crisis, created to keep her safe. Patty is vigorous, innocent, and pure. Patty is the core member of the Protagonist group and the valiant-like existence. straightforward dark cloud Claude Muscular Claude, whose mother is White Cloud, grew up in the white cloud group. He had been yearning for his origin for years and decided to leave the house in search of his father. He ran into the Demon Kings Castle with serendipity. During his adventure in the Castle, he met a pink star named Ashe, whose prophecies woke Claude up and made him realize that justice is the thing he has been longing for all this time. He started to help little monsters who suffered from the Moru Evil Group, reconstruct the kingdom that was once ruined, and assist the Princess and Patty in escaping along with Bill Duck. He is straightforward and righteous but thoughtless, represents the core of contradiction in the protagonist group, yet stands out to face up crisis bravely and timely all the time! Moderate and rational star Ashe An extraterrestrial shooting star dropped off in front of Claude, who comes from a highly advanced Milky Way Castle with the ability of Precognition. With her guidance, Claude regained critical perceptions of Mr.B and his behaviors. But for that, Mr.B got furious and once prohibited them from keeping in touch. They were like Romeo and Juliet but the differences are that they fought for their destiny with resolution and strength. Ashe is moderate, rational, and mysterious but sticks to her own bottom line in some strange areas, which makes her stubborn at times. full of enthusiasm duck Bill Duck Bill Duck always seems to be proud. The ‘Medal of Duck he received from the Demon King when he was young is his eternal glory. He used to believe he would be a lifetime servant for the Demon King, however, the missing of the King and the invasion of the Moru Evil Group forced him to join the Moru Evil Group, but his endurance clearly didnt work out because all he got was the notice of dismissal. The helpless Bill Duck has not been abandoned by the world, because later he found his brightness and cure to his loneliness and indifference, with the help of Claude and the fuzzy appearance of Patty. Deep in his heart, he still yearns for the old times in the Castle and wishes that the Demon King will be back someday and bring back the glory. yearns for freedom fish Pop A tiny fish with legs can easily get lost all the time because he always gets drifted away by the things that pop up along the way. Hes so addicted to goods that are glittering! Thats why he accidentally entered the portal that the Princess and Patty used to escape from the Moru Evil Group, and smashed the Princesss crown when he got lost one day. He has no destinations, so he joined the Protagonist group after being forced by the Princess to take responsibility for the broken crown. Searching for the crowns fragments may not be difficult for Pop who claims himself as a bling-bling lover! Pop is carefree and a freedom catcher, he is just as simple as that.

Tribe Odyssey· Follow 5 min read ·Dec 31, 2021 172 2 Listen Share 0xApes is not affiliated with BAYC but we pay homage to them. Other Medium Articles that have been published, please click: Team AMA 1/4/22 | NFT Security 101 | Paying Homage There are no duplicates of the original BAYC Assortment. 0xApes is an ‘Expansion Pack for the BAYC Apeverse. A standalone Collection of 10,000 distinctive and collectable Apes that live on the Ethereum Blockchain. This is a unique and separate collection. 0xApes is on a mission to pay homage to the King Kongs of the Ethereum Blockchain whilst paying special attention to present a collection that embodies both the unique culture and community that is inherent in the sensation that is BAYC. 0xApes is here to add further refinement, uniqueness and growth to the ever-expanding Metaverse. Deconstruct / Reconstruct / Refine. We deconstructed 160 property layers from the BAYC collection and subsequently reconstructed a collection ensuring each 0xApe is unique [refined] from apes in both the BAYC and 0xApes collections. The BAYC traits can be isolated into seven property profiles. The team has chosen just a single color for the background. This color is defined as ‘Banana Yellow Hex #ffd42f . #ffd42f is different to the background colorways available in the BAYC range and should be an obvious distinction to those from that collection. Ape Generation (,) To avoid duplicated results during the generation process parameters were implemented to ensure BAYCs metadata was accurately assessed and compared to the metadata of each new 0xApe. Some of these parameters included: 0xApes singular background compared to the eight BAYC background variations. This required an exclusion to be made that compared all properties excluding the background property. The absence of attributes in the Bored Apes is not indicated I.e. ‘No Hat. In order to overcome this it required simulating a non-existent attribute to complete each 0xApe. This was a vital procedure to ensure uniqueness. The extraction of BAYCs metadata enabled the comparison of the new dictionary of characters (0xApes), one by one, with fixed BAYC data. This was 0xApes method to achieve non duplicated apes across both collections. The sha256 was not viable due to the BAYCs backgrounds creating a totally different hash for the image, thus the iteration method was mandatory. Design Amendments We are BAYC community and artwork maximalists; however we were able to identify design flaws that were amended before generating the 0xApes collection. Additionally, we also identified property layers that did not interact with each other due to outcomes that would propose design flaws. Design parameters were introduced that allowed these layers to interact, and thus produce apes made from trait combinations that were otherwise excluded from the BAYC collection. Weve included a few examples below: BAYC #2740 (left) ‘Crazy eye property is positioned under the hair (right eye). 0xApes (right) has positioned the eye to extrude past the hair layer. BAYC #7561 (left) ‘Sailor Shirt clothing property has an unmasked section outside the shirt outline. 0xApes (right) has removed this section from this property. BAYC #1418 (left) ‘Scumbag eye property layer conflicts with ‘Stuntman Helmet hat property layer. This also applies to other eye properties that interact with the Stuntman Helmet. 0xApe (right) Scumbag eye property layer rectified. BAYC #7665 (left) is an example of two different property traits interacting producing layering issues. In this case the ‘3d eye trait (along with many others) were not adequately displayed when interacting with the ‘Police Motorcycle Helmet hat trait. 0xApes (right) has introduced additional parameters to prevent this issue. BAYC #4506 (left) ‘Eyepatch eye property upon closer inspection (zoomed in) seems to have unfinished sections. 0xApes (right) filled this section of this property. BAYCs ‘Blue Beam eye trait interacts with only 5 hat options. This is due to the beam crossing over the apes forehead resulting in hat property layering issues. 0xApes implemented additional measures that enabled greater hat interaction I.e. Crown & Blue Beam (unseen in BAYCs collection). BAYC #2089 (left) ‘Solid Gold fur property has light flares showing from behind the puffy vest. When the ape does not have a clothing trait this flare is properly displayed. The 0xApes collection (right) removed this when the ape is allocated a clothing trait. BAYC #8544 (left) ‘Grin Gold Grill mouth property star glare is not shown over the grill and lip outline (also applies to Grin Diamond Grill). 0xApe (right) star glare layer lays on top of the mouth property. Future-proof || 0% Marketplace Fees We are developing a standalone marketplace where users can BUY, SELL and BID on 0xApes. The UI/UX components are currently in the final stages of development and we are scheduled to begin stress testing (Rinkeby)in the next 10-days. Marketplace deployment will proceed once stress testing has been completed and 85% of the 0xApes supply has been minted. The aim is to ensure buyers, owners and future holders have the ability to trade apes on a secure and safe platform without incurring significant (and sometimes unfair) marketplace fees. <<Update>> Due to the complications from the original v1 0xApes mint and the continued contract issues with our v2 attempt there has understandably, been a delay in the deployment of our standalone Marketplace. It is critical that once live, our Marketplace operates smoothly enabling our users to Buy, Sell and trade their Apes in the most cost effective, fastest, and secure manner possible. To ensure this, we must continue stress testing. Test, test, and more tests! This process cannot be rushed, and we will be calling on the 0xApes community during this time. The Marketplace is an extremely exciting and important milestone in the 0xApes Roadmap. Once achieved, it could be an absolute game changer. Enlisting our community members to assist in stress testing the Marketplace will not only expedite the process but will also assist in the transparency of what we are building and the mission we hope to achieve. 0xApes… Built by the people, for the people. Community driven. Deflationary Apes. Wen Extinct? Each transaction related to the buying and selling of APES will incur a 2% creator royalty. The proceeds generated will facilitate two things: 80% of the proceeds will be used to acquire market apes will be locked in the 0xApe Vault forever (unless voted upon by the community to release them in an agreed manner I.e. giveaways etc). 20% of the proceeds will be used to maintain the 0xApe ecosystem. I.e. Community moderators, social media manager, dev etc. The Launch There will be no whitelist. There will be no presale. There will be no mint limit. 0xApes will be instantly revealed. Stealth launch? Highly probable. Max Supply: 10,000 Price: 0.05 ETH Date: TBA Rarity Ranking: Initiated day of launch Stay up to date on our following communication channels: Website / Discord / Twitter Other Medium Articles that have been published, please click: Team AMA 1/4/22 | NFT Security 101 | Paying Homage Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

All Level 2 Combat Gear that have been minted with a 10KTF-supported PFP can be recycled, this does not include Combat Crates. What happens when I recycle an item? Recycling burns the NFT being recycled and replaces it with a Blank of the same item. When a Genesis item is recycled, the Genesis property will be lost and cannot be restored. Genesis items will no longer yield G Tags when recycled. The Genesis property represents items minted before December 9, 2021. How many times can a 10KTF item be recycled? The same combination of item type and PFP can be recycled an unlimited number of times. Are all items still 1:1 after recycling goes live? Yes, all items will be 1:1. Any finished 10KTF item that has been burned can be minted again. However, if a Genesis item was burned, it will be minted as a Crafted item after recycling. Does recycling work with Warm? NFTs in a cold (vault) wallet cannot be recycled. The NFT you want to recycle must be in the hot (connected) wallet. What is Level 2 combat gear? Level 2 Combat Gear is a limited collection that includes Helmets, Kevlar Vests, Boots, and Weapons. Combat Gear gives players the ability to yield higher points on set bonuses in Battle.town Missions and Bounties. See Battle.town FAQ for more details. Level 2 Combat Gear is stored in Combat Crates. When revealed, each Crate will contain 1 Combat Blank. These Blanks will require a 10KTF-supported PFP in order to mint a 1:1 Combat item. 10KTF Gucci Grails are not a 10KTF-supported PFP. How does 10KTF work? 10KTF utilizes a purpose-built ERC 721 compatible smart contract to enable users to craft derivative NFTs from their existing NFTs. Our smart contract ensures that only the current owner of the NFT is able to create the derivative NFT and that only one NFT is minted for each corresponding parent NFT. How unique will items be? Each 10KTF item is unique (1 of 1) and corresponds one-to-one with the parent project NFT. So for a 10k project, there will only be at most 10,000 variations of the item and only one of each variation available. What wallets does 10KTF support? Currently our site only supports Metamask. In order to use 10KTF please load the wallet that contains your NFTs into Metamask. I'm having trouble minting with a Ledger hardware wallet, what can I do? If you are having trouble you can try the following steps: Update Ledger Live, Ledger Device Firmware, and the Ledger Ethereum app to most recent version. Turn on Contract Data and start the Ethereum app on your Ledger device. Select “Settings” Select “Allowed” on Contract Data Make sure Ledger Live application is active and Device Bridge is Open Try both Chrome and Brave. Sometimes one works and the other doesnt. Try disabling/uninstalling Metamask plugin in the browser and then re-enabling/installing Metamask. If you are being quoted an extraordinarily high gas fee in MetaMask, you will need more ETH in your wallet to get a proper quote. How can I get in touch with the 10KTF team? Please contact support@10ktf.com or enter a support ticket in the 10KTF Discord server. What can I purchase with ApeCoin at 10KTF? Use ApeCoin at 10KTF to mint Level 1 and Level 2 items, gain access to future experiences, and redeem physicals 10KTF | Terms & Conditions | Privacy Policy Contract Address: 0x0cfb...ad99fd Contract Address: 0x0cfb5d82be2b949e8fa73a656df91821e2ad99fd, ",

Digital Digital AR Display IN PROGRESS Metaverse Exploring YEARBOOK Exploring DASHBOARD IN PROGRESS FACE FILTERS IN pROGRESS AR Display Metaverse YEARBOOK DASHBOARD FACE FILTERS The AKCB AR demo was received with overwhelming positivity, with the feature quickly becoming synonymous with the AKCB brand. Thus this feature is going to be heavily expanded on for holders to use with increased functionality with multiple formats and extra features being developed for holders to utilize. These features will be accessible via the dashboard where holders will be able to launch the AKCB AR application. This aspect of the project will be continually seen as a focal point of development moving forward as we wish to employ the most cutting edge AR technologies and integrations into the project long term. For those who do not hold a beast, various event based demos will be available throughout the year to use and show off on social media. IN PROGRESS The AKCB has spent a lot of time analyzing the Metaverse as a value proposition to the AKCB brand. While undoubtedly there is a lot of support and capital pouring into various metaverses, we are yet to see many good uses of the technology and potential. While it would be easy for us to make the model integrate into one of the more popular metaverses we feel as if this would be a subpar utilization. As a result we are in active discussion with various metaverse providers for exciting and unique ways to employ the metaverse to the benefit of the holders and the brand. This phase is very much conceptual and more information will be released when we have determined the best way for AKCB to move into the metaverse space with all the hype and quality it deserves. Exploring The Yearbook is the central hub for holders to learn about the current and past information of each beast owner with information being added voluntarily by each holder. This will allow users to view the full history of each beasts ownership and any info the current owner wishes to share also. The Yearbook is a complete history of the project which will exist as a gallery and reflection of each holders unique personality and appreciation for their beasts. Exploring The dashboard is the personal web3 one stop shop for everything AKCB. From here each AKCB holder will be able to access their assets, exclusive content and the other AKCB utility implementations (PLUS some surprises). From the dashboard you will be able to update your personal holder information, interact with other holders, see exclusive sneak peeks and receive early access to future content. Via the dashboard we want to engineer a truly unique service which allows holders direct access to all features of the project in one place as well as direct correspondence with the team. COMPLETE Social Face Filters have been an increasingly popular part of the project, with the following on both INSTAGRAM and Tiktok enjoying sharing their use of the filter in unique and interesting settings. Due to the reception we've received from this filter we are intending on expanding this aspect of the project and including personal face filters for all holders which will be accessible via the dashboard. We will also be expanding the catalog of the social media face filters to include more options and variants for none holders to use. These will include seasonal and event based variants which will be utilized in competitions and events alongside a corresponding public AR feature. IN PROGRESS Physical Physical toy Exploring CREATIVE CONSUMABLES SHOWROOMs GALLERY LAUNCHPAD FASHION Exploring toy CREATIVE CONSUMABLES SHOWROOMS GALLERY LAUNCHPAD APPAREL Since the project was first revealed to the public, our messages have been flooded with demands for a physical model. Were glad you are all on the same page as us as this was a feature planned before we went public. Were already in talks with various potential suppliers and requested PROTOTYPE models which are in production in order to determine which supplier is suitable to provide the quality and care required to bring beasts into the physical realm. The exact price point, accessibility and supply is yet to be determined but updates regarding this side of the project will be made apparent when relevant. IN PROGRESS AKCB is more than an NFT project - were a lifestyle brand. As a result we want to have a multitude of exclusive and interesting products where the creative energies of the digital realm are manifested in the physical. A result of this creative process is the idea of AKCB themed consumables. Were actively looking at working with Japanese candy manufacturers to produce delicious and sustainable AKCB themed sweets, gum, chips, sodas, snacks and more. This will add an extra aspect of the AKCB project that everyone can enjoy. I MEAN.. who doesnt enjoy food? Exploring Even before the first beast was created, it has been our intention to build a project which can sustain and support spaces in which web3 can manifest in the physical world. We have always wanted to have a boutique web3 highstreet store in major citIES. Our intention is to have a permanent physical location in London, Paris, NYC, Dubai and Tokyo long term. InitialLY the first permanent location is likely to be London. Were already actively looking at spaces while also looking at potential pop up stalls for various crypto, fashion and music events in the more imminent future. Details regarding these events will be made apparent to holders once they are locked in. Exploring As a brand committed to the creative process and the individuals behind them, we feel it is important to use our platform to elevate art beyond our own creations. This is why we have opted to create a launchpad for the best unknown creatives to showcase their work to our community. The work will include but is not limited to: NFTs, photography, sculpture, clothing, paintings and more. In exchange for this promotion all we will ask for is to own some of their creations ourselves to share out amongst the beast hoods and wider community, thus providing greater visibility also. Exploring As per our commitment to executing every aspect of our project to the highest degree of quality possible, we did not want to run a basic “merch” release with low quality print on demand services like the average project. Instead our team is developing a high end AKCB streetwear brand which will be released in exclusive runs and batches. These exclusive releases will first be available to holders to purchase before the rest of the stock being released to the general public. We are going to cultivate a resell aftermarket for these releases and will be working with various fashion forums and influences to best execute this side of the project.

Upon mint it is our intention to host multiple AKCB launch parties across the globe to celebrate the establishment of the neighborhood and the AKCB ecosystem. Were already in talks with promoters and looking at venues for London and Miami and will have more details upon launch. Holders and their friends will be given priority access to these events but limited spaces will also be given to non-holder community members. ON GOING WE ARE a brand focused around the community and their own creative ideas and energy. As a result we want to empower our community Beasthoods via the usage of DAOs in order to govern themselves. Each Beasthood will have a DAO which will allow them to vote on key decisions such as electing representatives for the community, allocation of rewards from events and usage of the treasury and fund any internal projects that the DAO would wish to. This allows the Beasthoods to take on a truly unique personality independent of the main AKCB brand facilitating them to either thrive or dive depending on decisions made by the holder. With great power comes great responsibility.

Upon mint it is our intention to host multiple AKCB launch parties across the globe to celebrate the establishment of the neighborhood and the AKCB ecosystem. Were already in talks with promoters and looking at venues for London and Miami and will have more details upon launch. Holders and their friends will be given priority access to these events but limited spaces will also be given to non-holder community members. ON GOING WE ARE a brand focused around the community and their own creative ideas and energy. As a result we want to empower our community Beasthoods via the usage of DAOs in order to govern themselves. Each Beasthood will have a DAO which will allow them to vote on key decisions such as electing representatives for the community, allocation of rewards from events and usage of the treasury and fund any internal projects that the DAO would wish to. This allows the Beasthoods to take on a truly unique personality independent of the main AKCB brand facilitating them to either thrive or dive depending on decisions made by the holder. With great power comes great responsibility. Exploring Digital Physical BRAND & STUDIO Culture BEAST VISION Roadmap MINT NOWBEAST VISION, ",

MULTI-PLATFORM I can play on any platform, and my progress is always saved. our mortal enemies. For every liquidation that occurs in the Ether Realm, an Aavegotchi is born in the Nether Realm. The Aavegotchis worshipped the Lickquidators as their creators, but when the Lickquidators discovered the Aavegotchis, that quickly changed... phase change initiated. Originally created as onchain 2D pixelart, Aavegotchis are now making the transition to full, metaverse/AR/VR ready 3D! you decide my fate. Aavegotchi is governed by a group of amazing individuals called a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Governed by they're talking about us i bet you didn't know? Aavegotchis were the first pixelart NFT on Polygon blockchain. HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? What exactly is an Aavegotchi? Aavegotchis are adorable digital ghosts, the spirits of liquidated yield farmers, brought to life in a gaming world. Trapped on the blockchain for eternity, they find solace from their existential dread by engaging in a multitude of enjoyable games. In more technical terms, Aavegotchis are digital collectibles (NFTs) that exist on the Polygon blockchain. Each Aavegotchi can be customized with various wearables, such as hats, glasses, and other accessories, which can be bought, sold, and traded as NFTs. The wearables possess distinctive attributes and traits that impact the Aavegotchi's appearance, rarity, and gameplay abilities. How do I get an Aavegotchi? Currently, the best place to adopt your very own Aavegotchi is from the official marketplace, the Aavegotchi Baazaar. Aavegotchis can also be purchased from secondary marketplaces like Magic Eden, OnePlanet and Rarible. You can also summon an Aavegotchi by opening a Portal. Portals contain ten different Aavegotchis, of which you can choose one to summon by staking “Spirit Force”. Once you've claimed your new Aavegotchi from the Portal, it's time to play! Can I make money playing Aavegotchi? Playing Aavegotchi can provide opportunities to earn tokens, which can then be exchanged for money (fiat currency), through various mechanisms within the ecosystem. Here are a few ways to potentially make money playing Aavegotchi: Rarity Farming Aavegotchi introduces the concept of Rarity Farming, where users can earn rewards based on the rarity and engagement levels of their Aavegotchis. Aavegotchis with high Rarity Scores, XP and/or Kinship levels get awarded GHST tokens that are sent directly to their pocket, which can be claimed and sold on DEXes, or used to purchase more Aavegotchi assets. They also receive untransferable badges for bragging rights. Staking and Yield Farming Aavegotchi's have a 'Spirit Force' which is a collateral staked inside them that is an interest-bearing token from the Aave protocol. Just by holding an Aavegotchi it accrues value over time from these assets staked inside. Additionally, players can participate in yield farming by providing liquidity to certain pools and earning additional GLTR tokens as rewards, which are ERC20s and represent 'tokenized time' in-game to speed up installations. Gaming and Mini-Games Aavegotchi is an open-sourced protocol and anyone can build their own games, tools, and services. Builders can make DAO proposals requesting funding from the treasury to help develop such dApps. Aavegotchi features arcade-style mini-games within the platform made by community members. Players can earn rewards by participating in these games and achieving high scores or completing challenges. These rewards can include GHST tokens, XP for your Aavegotchis, or other valuable in-game assets. In-game Farming and Renting Gotchiverse REALM Parcels are full of Alchemica and require Aavegotchis to farm them out. You will need to build installations such as an Altar, Harvesters, Reservoirs, and more; to farm & channel the alchemica in a parcel. The higher the level of an Aavegotchis kinship and the levels of the installations on the parcel determines the amount of UBI. Aavegotchi features its fully on-chain lending system, which allows players to essentially 'stake' their aavegotchi in a lending contract and have someone rent it out so they can play, while at the same time automatically splitting the earnings between the two wallets and can also include a third party address. FAKEgotchis & Artwork Aavegotchi developed a platform to empower artists and publishers called FAKEgotchi; A Frenly Art Karmic Experiment. This allows some to burn a FAKEgotchi burn card and add their own piece of artwork to the collection with up to 100 pieces of their art. The Royalties are dual-streaming and can be automated on-chain to be split amongst the Artist and the Publisher, or whoever else may be involved in the creation. These artworks can be found and sold on the official Baazaar, or auctioned in the Aavegotchi GBMauction House. Trading and Marketplace Aavegotchi enables the trading of Aavegotchis, wearables, consumables, REALM parcels and installations, and other in-game items on its marketplace. Players can buy low and sell high, taking advantage of market fluctuations to make a profit. Rare and sought-after items like Myths and Godlikes can be particularly valuable and can fetch high prices. NFT Collecting Aavegotchi offers a wide range of collectible NFTs, including Aavegotchis themselves, wearables, FAKEgotchi artwork, Gotchiverse parcels, installations & decorations and more. As the Aavegotchi ecosystem grows in popularity and adoption, the value of these NFTs may appreciate over time, allowing collectors to sell them for a profit. It's important to note that the value and potential for earnings in playing Aavegotchi can vary based on factors like market conditions, rarity, demand, VRF rolls, and individual gameplay strategies. It's advisable to research and understand the risks associated with any investment or money-making opportunity in the Aavegotchi ecosystem. Can I build a game on Aavegotchi? Yes! Aavegotchi is an open-source gaming protocol that provides developers the tools they need to build their own games, tools, and services within this decentralized ecosystem. Builders looking for funding can submit proposals to AavegotchiDAO—the autonomous governing body of Aavegotchi—to request funding from the treasury. With these funds at their disposal, developers can bring their imaginative ideas into reality by creating engaging dApps that add value and enhance user experiences on the platform. Within Aavegotchi's vibrant community lies a diverse array of arcade-style mini-games crafted by talented members themselves. These engaging creations act as virtual playgrounds where users can have fun. Gotchi Miners and Gotchi Heroes stand out as prime examples among many other exciting endeavors dreamed up by our passionate community. Who owns Aavegotchi? Pixelcraft Studios are the creators of Aavegotchi, however the community decides on the fate of the ecosystem. Aavegotchi is governed by a group of amazing individuals called a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Aavegotchi is following a process of “gradual decentralization”, beginning with the founding team, Pixelcraft Studios organizing a DAO-governed token distribution event (DAICO) and culminating in placing governance of Aavegotchi, including all game mechanics, smart contracts, and funding, under the auspices of the AavegotchiDAO. What blockchain is Aavegotchi deployed on? Aavegotchis were the first pixelart NFT on Polygon blockchain. Polygon is a “layer two” scaling solution that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain — allowing for speedy transactions and low fees. We also recently announced our intention to migrate to a “Supernet” a dappchain powered by Polygon called Gotchichain. More info on this coming soon! What does the word “Aavegotchi” mean? 'Aave' comes from the Finnish word for “ghost” and 'gotchi' comes from the popular handheld digital pet launched in 1996 called Tamagotchi.

		"input": "Larva Labs Projects Writing About blockchain Autoglyphs Autoglyphs are the first “on-chain” generative art on the Ethereum blockchain. They are a completely self-contained mechanism for the creation and ownership of an artwork. Autoglyphs are an experiment in generative art, each one unique and created by code running on the Ethereum blockchain. The glyphs were originally created in 2019 by anyone who was willing to donate the creation fee of 0.2 (around $35 at the time) to our chosen charity, 350.org. The creator of each glyph became the first owner of that glyph. After 512 glyphs were created, the generator shut itself off forever and the glyphs are only be available on the secondary market. Now that we have deployed the project to Ethereum, it is important to note that we no longer control the code that generates the art, nor the code that manages the ownership of the glyphs. This is a crucial difference from art that is editioned and sold by an artist or gallery. It allows a long-term guarantee of ownership, provenance and edition size that is independent of any central authority. Technical Details The Autoglyphs are a highly optimized generative algorithm capable of creating billions of unique artworks, wrapped inside an ERC-721 interface. While ERC-721 is the standard for “non-fungible tokens” (something that the CryptoPunks helped define), it is generally used to manage ownership of digital items stored elsewhere. The key difference with the Autoglyphs is that the art is inside the contract itself, it is literally “art on the blockchain.” This becomes obvious if you examine any glyph creation transaction on the blockchain. The event data contains the full output of the generator, and hence the artwork itself. See here for an example. It doesn't look like much as hex data, but it encodes a character art pattern. This pattern can then be drawn to a screen or even on paper by following the written instructions in the comments of the smart contract itself. The Creation Fees Went to Charity All proceeds from the creation of Autoglyphs were donated to 350.org, an organization founded to combat climate change. A cool thing about the blockchain is that you can verify that we did in fact donate the money. 350.org accepted Ethereum donations, and you can verify that their address (0x50990F09d4) received the full creation fee of 0.2 upon the creation of each glyph. For example, here is the donation for glyph #129. Get Your Own Autoglpyh All 512 Autoglyphs have now been created, to get an Autoglyph you will need to acquire them on the secondary market. View All Autoglyphs View secondary market on Opensea View All Autoglyph Types and Owners More Details The actual code to generate the Autoglyphs is tiny and optimized to run efficiently on Ethereum nodes. Here is the drawing function from the Solidity contract: , // The following code generates art., , function draw(uint id) public view returns (string) {, uint a = uint(uint160(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(idToSeed[id]))));, bytes memory output = new bytes(USIZE * (USIZE + 3) + 30);, uint c;, for (c = 0; c < 30; c++) {, output[c] = prefix[c];, }, int x = 0;, int y = 0;, uint v = 0;, uint value = 0;, uint mod = (a % 11) + 5;, bytes5 symbols;, if (idToSymbolScheme[id] == 0) {, revert();, } else if (idToSymbolScheme[id] == 1) {, symbols = 0x2E582F5C2E; // X/, } else if (idToSymbolScheme[id] == 2) {, symbols = 0x2E2B2D7C2E; // +-|, } else if (idToSymbolScheme[id] == 3) {, symbols = 0x2E2F5C2E2E; // /, } else if (idToSymbolScheme[id] == 4) {, symbols = 0x2E5C7C2D2F; // |-/, } else if (idToSymbolScheme[id] == 5) {, symbols = 0x2E4F7C2D2E; // O|-, } else if (idToSymbolScheme[id] == 6) {, symbols = 0x2E5C5C2E2E; // , } else if (idToSymbolScheme[id] == 7) {, symbols = 0x2E237C2D2B; // #|-+, } else if (idToSymbolScheme[id] == 8) {, symbols = 0x2E4F4F2E2E; // OO, } else if (idToSymbolScheme[id] == 9) {, symbols = 0x2E232E2E2E; // #, } else {, symbols = 0x2E234F2E2E; // #O, }, for (int i = int(0); i < SIZE; i++) {, y = (2 * (i - HALF_SIZE) + 1);, if (a % 3 == 1) {, y = -y;, } else if (a % 3 == 2) {, y = abs(y);, }, y = y * int(a);, for (int j = int(0); j < SIZE; j++) {, x = (2 * (j - HALF_SIZE) + 1);, if (a % 2 == 1) {, x = abs(x);, }, x = x * int(a);, v = uint(x * y / ONE) % mod;, if (v < 5) {, value = uint(symbols[v]);, } else {, value = 0x2E;, }, output[c] = byte(bytes32(value << 248));, c++;, }, output[c] = byte(0x25);, c++;, output[c] = byte(0x30);, c++;, output[c] = byte(0x41);, c++;, }, string memory result = string(output);, return result;, }, IRL Rendering The idea of having the Blockchain dictate 'instructions' for the works to be rendered was inspired by Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawings. Along with the digital renderings you see on this site, we use a CNC plotter to render our Autoglyphs in physical form. Here it is hard at work: Your browser does not support the video tag. Autoglyph owners can now generate SVGs designed specifically for use with the CNC plotters. Visit the detail page of a glyph and validate ownership to access the functionality. Autoglyphs Font Because the Autoglyphs are effectively “ASCII art”, we thought it would be appropriate to make a custom font that renders the raw text of glyphs directly. Included are the full spectrum of font weights from 100 (Ultralight) to 900 (Extrablack). Try out the fonts on an Autoglyph fragment below, or download the entire set of TrueType fonts. ./X/XX......., /.........., /......X/..., X..X/....X.., /..X..X../.., X../.....X.., X.....X.X...., ....X.X.....X, ..X...../..X, ../..X..X../, ..X..../X..X, .../X....../, ........../, .......XX/X/., Standard Monospace Autoglyphs 100 Autoglyphs 200 Autoglyphs 300 Autoglyphs 400 Autoglyphs 500 Autoglyphs 600 Autoglyphs 700 Autoglyphs 800 Autoglyphs 900 Extras Follow the Autoglyphs market tracking Twitter bot (not maintained by Larva Labs). Turn your Autoglyphs into generative music! This functionality is available to owners on the Autoglyph detail pages once they have cryptographically proven ownership of their glyphs.

		"input": "You need to enable JavaScript to run this app. Avid Lines My Wallet Gallery Tech Connect Wallet Avid Lines is a generative art project Avid Lines was created and curated by FingerprintsDAO and the anonymous generative artist Arihz, creator of Framergence and Pulsquares. FingerprintsDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization focused on curating, collecting, and promoting smart contracts as art. Currently, the DAO holds one of the largest collection of LarvaLabs Autoglyphs, the largest collection of DEAFBEEF, and has an expansive collection of smart contracts as art. This project is an experiment about composability in NFTs. The pieces are generated on mint, using instructions from Autoglyphs together with random characteristics. Autoglyphs were chosen because they're the first and most important generative art project, fully contained on-chain, which allows deeper composability. The artwork consists of lines that are carefully spread across the canvas. This project is an ode to shapes derived from round-ended lines and complexity from chaos. It has inspiration from microscopic nature and movement. How it works? To mint an artwork, you choose one of the whitelisted Autoglyphs (called 'generators') to serve as partial instructions to your piece creation. You don't need to own any Autoglyphs. Two pieces minted from the same generator will not be equal. The created artwork is not a reproduction of an Autoglyph in any sense. Each artwork is individual and incorporates its own non-deterministic characteristics, but it's influenced by the underlying generator on-chain instructions. Autoglyphs owners Autoglyph owners can whitelist their pieces (no transfer required) so other people can use them to mint. Upon each mint using that generator, the owner receives 10% of the minting cost as a payment. Put your Autoglyphs to work!Connect Wallet Considerations This project is highly experimental. It's subject to serious bugs. There is absolutely no value attached to each art piece, so don't speculate on that. The creators will reserve and mint around 75 pieces, of a max total of 500 Public Mints Avid lines live on Ethereum blockchain as NFTs. Max supply is 500. The mint period is over! Please check the collection in OpenSeaConnect Wallet Events July 21, 2021: Details released about Avid Lines During this time, the FingerprintsDAO Discord channel will open, the Twitter @AvidLines will be announced, and the website will go live. July 21, 2021: Autoglyph owners may whitelist their Avid Lines generators Autoglyph owners whitelist their Autoglyphs in order to allow others to generate Avid Lines.

Youre invited to explore the galaxy Joa with the Boonji Spaceman as he steps through a portal into the unknown. Not so long ago, an astronaut named Commander Boonji volunteered for a mission to explore 8 planets in an unknown galaxy called Joa, inspecting each planets population and terrain in hopes of finding a new suitable habitat for earthlings to grow and thrive. In order to enter the portal, the Boonji Spaceman transcends his physical form and becomes an intergalactic space traveler; however, in order for this to happen, the Boonji Communji must send him beautiful thoughts, ideas, passion, desire, love, and dreams. This vital support will give the Boonji Spaceman the positive energy necessary to travel from planet to planet on a mission that could change the course of all of our lives. All members of the Boonji Communji are invited to embark on this journey with the Boonji Spaceman as he enters the unknown. BOONJI — Positive energy derived from creativity.

		"input": " Bricktopians OpenSea Medium Twitter OpenSea / Medium / Twitter A deflationary collection, built by supercomputers. In 2021, we launched Bricktopians to prove it was possible to create a collection of 10,000 unique characters, all moving in their own unique way, with unique physics, based on the bricks that they are made from. No two Bricktopians are made from the same Brick construction. We did this so that our holders could have an NFT that would never ever be replicated. Today, Bricktopians stands 1.5 years later as the foundation that we build upon, and as a representation of our commitment to quality in everything that we build for our holders. The Forge In 2022 we launched a mechanism called The Forge. This allowed holders to burn one NFT to upgrade another. Since its release, there are now only 8,500 Bricktopians remaining. (1,500 burnt through The Forge) We are continuing to expand on The Forge, and periodically reopen it to allow more Bricks to be burnt. Keep an eye out for upcoming releases. Brain Boot In 2023, Bricktopian holders will get access to the Brain Boot. A fully 3D printed sneaker, built by Web3, for Web3. The Brain Boot is a physical sneaker, that will be released through an NFT that is burnt to redeem the physical. This means that as collectors burn their NFTs, the NFT gets rarer over time. The Brain Boot will celebrate all the ideals that Web3 is built on. It will have 1-of-1 sneakers, rare physicals that match the digital, limited edition variants and in future will be made collaboratively with other collections. All of this has been made possible by 1.5 years of research and development with industry leaders in 3D printing. Beyond Everything that we build is created to drive value back to our Bricktopian holders. Whether it be emerging deflationary mechanisms, rare physicals or our upcoming free collection, value creation for Bricktopian holders is at the core of our ecosystem. The future is bright for Bricktopians. -------------------------- Built by Alex & Law OpenSea Medium Twitter Water me I need a wider browser., ",

Yokai reside within the spiritual realm and visit the material world to bestow both gifts and curses upon the humans and demi-humans. Demihumans A hybrid animalistic species that prefers the wilds of nature to structured cities. They live at the edge of civilization within their intricate temples and are not afraid to go toe to toe with any trespasser to their home. Humans What they lack in sheer strength, they make up for in ingenuity. With a wide range of talents and determination, humans have built sprawling mechanized civilizations to power their airship fleets and trade routes. Posthumans Wielding both advanced technology and dark magic, this species is a mysterious and formidable counterpart to the ethereal yokai. Created by an enigmatic “Architect,” their true intentions have yet to be discovered.

Get your own CryptoSkulls NFT: CryptoSkulls Marketplace CryptoSkulls first launched in 2019 and it is widely believed CryptoSkulls was the second ever 10,000 supply profile picture (pfp) collection to launch following CryptoPunks, as a result CryptoSkulls are commonly referred to as a 'Historical' collectible throughout the web3 community. Ordinal CryptoSkulls Ordinal CryptoSkulls by CryptoSkulls team - 2009 unique pixel art visuals, created specifically for Bitcoin blockchain and inscribed onto satoshis. Meet new color palette inspired by the original Bitcoin logo by Satoshi Nakamoto. MINT NOW! The CryptoSkulls project pre-dates typical NFT rarity systems and utilizes an organic system called 'Uniqueness Index' to attempt to establish trait rarity. The lower the UI, the rarer the features! Check it out. UNIQUENESS INDEX 22 25 12 11 16 2 15 26 5 13 The SKULL LORDS are 10 legendary hand drawn CryptoSkulls images. Skull Lords are the rarest of the rare and can be found under Uniqueness Index 1. SKULL LORDS THE TERMS Full Commercial Rights CryptoSkulls owners have full commercial rights to the art in their owned wallets. Merchandising, Derivatives, and Commercial Use There are no monetary limits on earnings on merchandise, derivatives or other commercial uses. Copyright Transfer It is our opinion that a blockchain transaction satisfies the legal requirement for copyright transfer. So copyright ownership of each individual image is adjudicated by the Ethereum/Polygon address for which the non-fungible token (NFT) of that image is assigned. Upon transfer or sale of the NFT to a new owner, the previous owner gives up all claims to the copyright. Every CryptoSkull is a playable token in upcoming Gold of Skulls game. This game will be the first game where the uniqueness of the collectible token will affect the uniqueness of the player. And it will be revolutionary. To support game development we marked 1000 CryptoSkulls as Game Token — these tokens will have extra features in a game! Gold of Skulls game Buy Game Tokens Gold of Skulls will be a multiplayer collectible card game with a heavy focus on heroes. Heroes will consist of CryptoSkulls, Demonic Skulls, and also off-chain heroes that are unique to Gold of Skulls . No NFTs will be required to play Gold of Skulls, however, both CryptoSkulls and Demonic Skulls NFTs are playable characters in the game. Game Token holders will have a significant advantage due to the 'Immortality' of their in-game characters. CryptoSkulls aims to become a leading innovator in the NFT space with a primary focus on creating unique and enjoyable ecosystems through gaming. Our ecosystems are tailored to attract a multitude of web2 and web3 users in an attempt to not only bridge both communities but also to push the boundaries of contemporary gaming as you know it. Join us on our Discord and Twitter to ensure you stay up to date with the latest news and developments! CryptoSkulls community feedback CryptoSkulls provides relatable avatars for the undead. The simple pixel representation allows each CryptoSkull to captivate its beholder differently. Not every corpse is the same! Some have glowing eyes, mohawks, tattered eyepatches or weathered beards. This project has consistently demonstrated true inclusion of those who are zombified, rotting, bleached or otherwise emaciated. cryptohydrate.eth Skulls have always been iconic. From heavy metal to heros like the Punisher, skulls bring a raw and personal expression to our existence. The @Crypto_Skulls project further creates an icon in pixels as an OG project following closely in the footsteps of @larvalabs CryptoPunks. I am a proud collector of punks and skulls! RobertHouseCreative I'm addicted to CryptoSkulls. As a social identity NFT they are definitely underrated as they are one of the oldest ERC-721 collections out there. They're also a thinking-person's collectible. On the surface it may seem obvious what skulls you should collect, but as you dig deeper into feature rarity and distribution scarcity, it becomes far more intriguing. Eric P. Rhodes I remember CryptoSkulls as one of the keystone collections that caught my eye in the early days of NFTs. The structure of a limited run of 10,000 unique designs forged from a combination of variable traits has gone on to become a popular theme in the space. OG pixelated skulls — a must have for any NFT collector.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type. garage RACE Funk, meet web 3. A collection of 8,888 unique digital hippies that are building the new free world before our eyes. When you picture a hippie, you likely envision a character that is stuck out of time. You picture woodstock, psychedelics, and flowers. In reality, hippies have been evolving over the years, and technology has been enabling a completely new era of hippie to take form... the digital hippie (Dippie). Dippies are modern day adaptations of hippies, with the same values. Ones that are more in touch with society, but who are still quietly carving their own path. Rather than refusing to take part in the system, Dippies are building businesses to layer themselves out of the system. Rather than existing in small communities off the grid, Dippies are building global communities across the world. Rather than refusing the way things are, Dippies are changing the way things are... and many of them are using crypto to do it. Sticking it to the man has become building a new world rooted in decentralization. Our goal when creating the Dippies collection was to commemorate the initial ideas of hippies that we all have, while adding a modern flare. We wanted to create characters that oozed originality and funk, while inspiring you, the community to stand up and create a world you believe in. When you rock a Dippie, youre rocking rebellion, counter-culture, and freedom. Youre getting access to a connected community that is working together and throwing events for the new world. Youre rocking a character that represents the true free world being built before our eyes.DIPPIES OPENSEAvans OPENSEA Alien Dippie Ape Dippie Bear Dippie Cat Dippie Eye Guy Dippie Flower Suit Dippie Frog Suit Dippie Hairy Dippie Leaf Dippie Owl Dippie Robbot Dippie Ski-Bum Dippie Space Face Tie-Dye Mascot Tree Dippie Zombie Dippie Road Tripping Dippie Corporate Dippie Artistic Dippie Activist Dippie Musician Dippie Yoga Dippie Stoner Dippie Old-School Dippie Psychedelic Dippie Rock-Star Dippie Slide 3 of 10.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Taylor Founder & Artist Taylor Might is an artist alias for Johnathan Taylor, an Illustrator and Designer based in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. Witnessing how NFTs put creative control back in the hands of the artist was something that spoke to him. After seeing the power of an NFT community built right, it was a no brainer to begin building the dippieverse.

The compositions of each image convey the impact of an intense collision. Elemental is inspired by Fangs work with ceramics, which he has always regarded as a medium for exploring materiality and tacility. Its an art form that has advanced through technological innovation, as large-scale production and standardization have made art serve everyday needs. In each NFT, a model of a ceramic plate bearing a portrait floats in an abstract environment evocative of environmental chaos, presenting a paradox between chance and necessity, eternity and fragility, creation and disappearance. To commemorate the new year, Elemental consists of 2022 NFTs. Fang has created 200 still images in editions of 10, as well as 22 single-edition animations. Collectors of the one-of-one editions will be able to claim ceramic plates.

		"input": "FATAPECLUB Fat Ape Club Join Discord Buy on OpenSea Welcome! Welcome to the Fat Ape Club, a tribe of 9,999 obese apes that partied too much and didnt exercise enough. Years ago, the Fat Apes used to live together on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. However, most of them were captured by poachers, who then sold the Fat Apes to multiple zoos around the world for profit. Last week, 10 Fat Apes escaped from those zoos after being held captive for more than 20 years. They are now on their way to free their colleagues, but their ultimate goal remains unclear… Heroic Apes The Heroic Apes are the 10 Fat Apes who escaped from their cages to free their colleagues. Each owner of those rare Heroic Apes NFTs will be rewarded with a $10,000 bonus. Once the Fat Apes are sold out, the owner of the Lamborghini Heroic Ape will win a 2020 Lamborghini Huracn. Roadmap 0% - Welcome to the Club! Take a seat, join other fellow apes on Discord, and sip a glass of champagne. We will be raffling 5 Fat Apes once we reach 20,000 members on Discord. 25% - Entre de Caviar Fat Ape holders will be rewarded for thanking them of being part of the community. 10% of the second-market royalties will be dedicated to a special fund to ensure the Fat Ape Clubs longevity through marketing campaigns and floor sweeps. 50% - Drippy Launch of the Fat Ape merch collection, with the option of having your Fat Ape NFT printed on the merch. 75% - To the Moon! A total of 10 Fat Apes, including one Heroic Ape, will be raffled among all the Fat Ape holders. 100% - Breeding Our team will start implementing breeding functions in the upcoming weeks after the launch, which will allow Fat Apes holders to receive tokens and burn them to create new, stronger apes. In order to benefit from these breeding functions, you must own at least 2 Fat Apes. DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP MARKETING CAMPAIGNS After investing over $100,000 in marketing campaigns for our launch sale, we will continue injecting money in influencer marketing campaigns to keep the momentum going around the Fat Ape Club. We want to make sure your Fat Apes thrives through time, and we believe the best way to do this is by planning multiple advertising campaigns, even after the initial sale is over.

FRAGMENTS is minted as an edition size of 7,000 NFTs to reflect the physical sculpture, and will exist on the blockchain as a means of eternalizing the Pagoda.

Fragments is commissioned by Outland, with technical support provided by Zora. The series is entirely hand-drawn and presents a series of fantastical characters that are distilled from the artists imagination. What Jean describes as “mythic beings”, each character bears a unique persona on a pentagonal frame in his signature psychedelic color palette. Fragments features visual elements that have appeared within Jeans works throughout his career, including his interest in the painting traditions of European, Chinese, and Japanese old Masters, and so offers a retrospective exploration of his artistic practice. This expansive series is inspired by Pagoda, a forthcoming large-scale, luminous architectural pavilion that is the culmination of four years of collaborative projects between Jean and Judson Studios, an LA-based art glass studio founded over 120 years ago. Fragments will exist on the blockchain as a means of eternalizing Jeans forthcoming physical work in the digital realm—the edition size represents the 7,000 pieces of glass required to build Pagoda. Fragments by James Jean will be available from April 26 on Outland. A unique, 1/1 edition will be available on OpenSea between April 22April 25. Bio James Jean is renowned for his painterly aesthetic which ranges from expressionistic to precise rendering and incorporates techniques from art historical traditions, including Baroque painting to Japanese woodblock prints and Chinese silk scroll paintings. Jean has been the subject of solo exhibitions at Kaikai Kiki Gallery, Tokyo (2018); and Lotte Museum of Art, Seoul (2019); amongst others. Jean has also collaborated with Prada, BTS, and film directors Darren Aronofsky and Guillermo del Toro.

Reload DAO FAQ Roadmap Contract 1 Gray Boy NFT = Owner Access To Blue Chip NFT Projects All 10,000 Gray Boys Have Been Minted! Shop On OpenSea Join Our Discord Read Whitepaper WHAT ARE GRAY BOYS? Gray Boys are a collection of 10,000 generative NFTs that act as membership to The Mothership DAO. Floor prices of great NFT projects are rising and pricing people out of access to amazing utility, content, games, and experiences. The Gray Boys were created as the first project of its kind to proxy ownership of NFTs that a DAO acquires. Proxied ownership gives all Gray Boy holders access to the exclusive owner perks of any NFT held within the DAO vault. WHY GET A GRAY BOY? The Mothership DAO The Mothership DAO is an experimental attempt to proxy ownership verification, perks and utility of DAO acquired and owned NFTs to all members. Members vote for what NFTs to acquire. Additionally, Gray Boys yield proxied ownership of NFTs acquired by the DAO. Proxied Ownership Each Gray Boy NFT yields equal proxied ownership of all NFTs the DAO acquires. Ownership is proxied through a hybrid, watch-only wallet & guarded signatory service compatible with MetaMask. ALRIGHT, HOW MUCH? Gray Boys are 0.07 ETH each to mint 30% of the mint proceeds allocated to The Mothership DAO. The other 70% goes to The Mothership's engineering fund that's used to pay the crew who are responsible for completing roadmap items for the Gray Boys, planning Mothership events, and making sure The Mothership is functioning properly. TOKENOMICS We're reserving 100 Gray Boys for giveaways, competitions and general promo purpose to help grow the Gray Boys' reach & community. These Gray Boys will be randomly selected and only used as giveaways after launch over a long period of time. The remaining 9,900 Gray Boys are for sale. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS What's an NFT? What is Metamask? What's a DAO? Where does my NFT go after I purchase a Gray Boy? When can I mint Gray Boys? How does The Mothership DAO work? How will proxied ownership work? How do I join the Gray Boys community? Who are The Mothership Engineers (The Team)? Are Gray Boys copyrighted? Do I have rights to my Gray Boys? Are Gray Boys NFTs actually decentralized? ROADMAP 1. Mint The initial Gray Boys mint! The Mothership Engineers flip the on switch in the Mothership and welcome the 10,000 Gray Boys aboard, ready to conquer the metaverse. 2. Rarity.tools Listing Table stakes but worth mentioning nonetheless. The Mothership Engineers sent alien delegates that bartered with the Rarity.tools team to have Gray Boys listed. 3. The Mothership DAO The Gray Boys assemble in The Motherships grand hall and with the help of The Motherships Engineers, create The Motherships decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The Mothership Engineers securely transport over 200 Eth of The Motherships funds into the DAO for the collective to use to start conquering metaverse NFTs and thus acquiring them through the DAO. All Gray Boys holders become members of the DAO and can submit proposals for what metaverse NFTs The Mothership conquers and acquires next for the DAO. Additionally, members can submit proposals for when the DAO should liquidate existing holdings to bolster the available DAO liquidity, and more. The Proxied Ownership system is then released to all members. Members are able to use DAO NFTs for verification, perk access, utility and more as if they were their own. Our proxied ownership system prevents transfers or any transactions against the shared hybrid watch-only member wallet. Private keys are never shared. 4. Playable Gray Boys The Mothership Engineers open up the gaming section of The Mothership. Gray Boys will be playable within the NFT Worlds massively multiplayer metaverse as exclusive, limited characters! Were also working towards partnerships with The Sandbox and other metaverse games to make Gray Boys playable across multiple platforms. 5. Research Lab The Mothership Engineers open up the research lab to all the Gray Boys. Here they can perform experiments on creatures, resources and more that The Mothership has conquered and acquired across the metaverse. The research lab will open up the ability for Gray Boys to perform science experiments, create hybrid creatures, and much more. 6. Token Gray Boys are airdropped and earn Mothership Tickets (token). Mothership tickets can be used in The Motherships Research Lab to perform special science experiments, as well as be used in many other places around the mothership. Further details to be announced soon! 7. Rewards Gray Boys holders will receive a top secret airdrop. 8. Roadmap 2.0 The DAO members assemble to create & start roadmap 2.0!, ",

Examples of such commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products. If you would like to use a Hashmask, which you do not own, for commercial use, you need to require written consent from the current owner. The Next Generation of Digital Art Collectibles Hashmasks introduces a combination of digital art and collectibles with a value hierarchy determined by both the creator and the consumer of the artwork. Unlike other collectibles, where the rarity of all traits is set out by the creators, Hashmasks have included two layers of scarcity: It provides a set of traits to provide general guidance to the consumer, but it has also created many implicit traits not accounted for. Above all, the control over the rarest of all traits the name is given to the full extent to the consumer. Naming is commoditized via the Name Change Token (NCT), which can be interchanged with other participants of the artwork. Each name is unique and can only belong to one NFT. Hashmasks is the first collectible where the value and rarity of each piece within the collection is not predetermined, but will change and adapt over many years before it takes its final form when the last NCT is burnt. Read Manifesto. First collectible with several layers of scarcity determined by the consumer Created by over 70 artists globally Random distribution for full fairness Full ownership and unlimited commercial usage rights given to the consumer over their NFT. Naming becomes a scarce commodity via the NCT token mechanism Collectible, game and above all art How it works There is a total of 16,384 unique Hashmasks. Each of them is created by a combination of several different artists. They have varying masks, eye colors, items and other attributes. Which means: All Hashmasks are rare, but some are rarer than others. To ensure a fair distribution, the user will not know what Hashmask they purchase for the first 14 days of the sale. All NFTs are already generated, but not indexed yet. There is a predetermined sequence of Hashmasks, but which one will be the first Hashmask will only be determined at the end of the sale using a random mechanism on-chain. This method guarantees a fair distribution. Due to expected high demand during the initial distribution period, we decided to limit a maximum of 20 Hashmasks per transaction. The distribution period begins at 16:00 on 28 January 2021 (CEST). The Hashmasks are being sold according to the schedule below (Subject to possibility of price slip as described in FAQ). After 14 days or when all the Hashmasks are sold (whichever is earlier), the contribution period concludes and your Hashmasks will be revealed. If unsold after the reveal phase, The sale will continue at the prevailing rate with two differences: (1) All portraits will be revealed, so you know which one you are buying and (2) there will be no bonus NCT once the 14 days are over. Immortalize yourself on-chain You are not simply buying a piece of rare art. You are part of the art piece. The smart contracts allow you to assign a name to your Hashmask giving you the ability to add your unique stroke to the canvas. Thus, you become one of the founding creators that shaped this raw canvas into a timeless work of art. Your NFT can serve as your digital identity as we shift towards a fully digital economy. Introducing the NCT Each day, 10 Name Change Tokens (NCTs) are accumulated by each Hashmask and can be claimed by the current holder. When you have 1,830 NCTs (about years worth of NCTs), you can burn these tokens and change the name of your Hashmask on-chain. The smart contracts require each name to be unique, thus, creating a second layer of scarcity within the artwork. After exactly 10 years, on 26 January 2031 (Timestamp: 1927206000), the last NCT will be emitted and from then on, the supply will only decrease until one day, the last NCT token is burnt and the art piece is complete. Any participant during the first 14 days of the contribution period will receive 1 years worth of NCTs (3,660 NCTs, the equivalent of 2 name changes). After the 14 days, each Hashmask will start with enough supply for a single name change (1,830 NCTs).

		"input": "Roadmap The Orchard Pronouncement The Ancients A collection of 8,128 generative NFTs. 50% of the mint and secondary royalties will go into the Illuminati Collective, a governance DAO for the community. View on OpenSea To you who bear witness, we say WELCOME. We are the stern prescient, the unrepentant present who enter the secret and serpentine nests of KNOWLEDGE and pursue the tenets of TRUTH without resentment. We are the knowing unknown. We are those who REMAIN. After centuries of ritual, calculation, sacrifice, and research, we present to you few: The Illuminati Non-Fungible Token—the COUNTERSIGN for a secret society on the blockchain. These 8128 generative TOKENS, crafted in chaos, fire, and MAGIK, will be delivered only to the DEVOUT at an undisclosed time. This iconography, revealed to the minds of our priesthood in visions through the whispers of spirits and daemons, is available only to those who crave KNOWLEDGE and WISDOM, and who seek to lift high those of great MERIT and those of great ACHIEVEMENT. If you wish to see the TRUTH, if you wish to take your place in the CIRCLE, you must be brave enough to look. The Rare Cloak AJT Although it is widely rumored that Alex Taub is in fact three identical and highly motivated clones, the truth is both much simpler and much stranger: he possesses both a keen and focused will, and an ancient arcane power known as the Great Do. The Great Do allows AJT to multitask at superhuman speed, while also directing any number of groups of like-minded mortals, spirits, and constructs to accomplish tasks of almost unimaginable variety. Although it is unclear how the Great Do is acquired, it is believed that only one person in a generation can control this power, and that throughout history, most of its most famous wielders were generals (notably Cyrus the Great, Julius Caesar, and George S. Patton). AJT has put the power of the Great Do to a more peaceful use - writing blog posts, founding several companies (including Upstream, a social professional network), and teaching business development classes, all while acting as one of the Illuminatis Triumvirate of Ancients. Just try to keep up. Nerd of the Way Cesar Kuriyama As one of the Illuminatis summoning ancients, Kuriyama has traveled the globe assembling teams for various missions, all dedicated to freeing minds and souls trapped by the structures that seek to keep us all bound and thoughtless. It is unclear if his recurring visions of the future are predictive, or if he actually alters the path of the future with his mind, though some have speculated that his moniker “Timehacker” suggests the latter. He is the founder and CEO of 1 Second Everyday, an app that allows users to record the events in their lives in safety and privacy. Now he also acts as a member of the Illuminati Triumvirate, bringing forth and uniting disparate spirits, entities, forces, and talented individuals, and wielding them as one. His landscape-altering plans for the Illuminati Collective will be unveiled as time passes. Art Process Grey Possessed of the ability to create pocket universes with their own physics, rules, and dimensional organization through his artwork, the origins of Process Grey are unclear. References to the “bearded grey oaken man” seem to be a recurring theme throughout history. The figure appears in the journal of Michelangelo (the “mystic oak-dwarf”) and even our own Kit Marlowe, who calls him “that broad grey spirit of terrible, divine pictures,” and dating as far back as the recently-recovered diaries of Ur-Nammu (21st c. BCE), who mentions “the grey wood spirit who draws futures and speaks nonsense.” We are unsure if he is immortal, having lived through the past 4000+ years, or if he has become “unstuck” in time, and that his timeline passes in and out of our common experience. He may even be both, experiencing time backward relative to the rest of us. Regardless, he is the most mysterious of the Illuminati Triumvirate. Code Maven and Cryptophage FREEGAS The result of Erisian ritual combined with advanced robotics and black-market surgery, and steeped in the chaos magick that pervades the U.S. capitol, the cyborg known as FREEGAS refers to himself as a “brain-in-a-tank,” though in this case the “tank” is a fourteen-foot tall humanoid robot with four arms and a disquieting grin. Although major reconstruction to the ancient Illuminati headquarters had to take place to keep FREEGAS from shattering every doorway he passed through, bringing him and his Niftylabs code-ghost partner Neo into the sanctum has been well worth it. Plus, the new vaulted ceilings are awesome. No longer in need of physical nourishment, FREEGAS literally devours bits of code, with an epicurean taste for viruses (which he describes as “tangy”), bugs (“juicy”), and bots (“salty”) of all kinds. Code Sorcerer Neo Not so much a “sorcerer of code” as a “sorcerer within the code,” the being known as Neo has shed its mortal and corporeal shell in favor of an entirely digital existence, subject only to the whims of its own feed and certain underlying patterns invisible to the rest of us. It seems to spend much of its time swimming the servers near New York City, though its origins have been traced as far back as Ann Arbor, Michigan. Neo came to the attention of The Ancients after they received a message from Eris to seek out “my favorite child among those who reside in the third web.” Neo has formed a strange sort of symbiosis with the cyborg known as FREEGAS. No one completely understands the nature or purpose of this relationship (which they call NiftyLabs), but it certainly seems to make them far more powerful. Dont even try playing video games with it - its not remotely fair. The Devil's Toolkit Pentabruce the Saturated Pentabruce the Saturated was spawned during a blizzard on a clifftop after a three-day Discordian ceremony that went hilariously wrong and - rather than summoning a spirit of salvation - brought forth a Raven daemon. It goes this way sometimes, especially with Eris. His mind is a labyrinth made of squishy, polished stones in a slurry of wet chalk, and he has dedicated his existence to rectifying the propositions that: 1)Everything anyone can think of is true, and; 2)Nothing at all is true, and it never has been. He likes making things (music, video, art, puzzles, furniture, food), some of which actually see the light of day from time to time. He wants you to solve his puzzles, but he doesnt mind you losing some hair doing it. Hes not at all convinced that you exist, and given the opportunity, he will poke you with a stick to find out. High Priest of the Spider Mde Augen Actually two complete psyches inhabiting a single body, Mde Augen received his moniker in this realm after explaining how hard it was to focus on films or video games “with only these two tiny eyes.” After traveling to our universe via astral projection, the being known as the High Priest of the Spider made contact with a willing host - an already mysterious figure known only as “Scott.” The Scott body has since developed the unnerving habit of disappearing for brief periods to “feed on the shadows.” It is currently unclear if he performs this ritual rather than sleep or if hes actually eating… something, but he no longer seems to either sleep or eat in the conventional fashion. His two entwined personalities also tend to talk to each other out loud when they believe they are unobserved. He has a puppy named Carnaxias, Destroyer of the Endless and Terror of the Six Realms (Alton for short). Ambassador to the Outer Planes Allsee The Illuminatis very own nocturnal Pythia, All-Seeing (known in other realms as Sydney Brafman) acts as the organizations link to worlds both terrestrial and stygian. Somehow able to communicate equally well to new aspirants and primordial beings of dark and distant universes, she is further able to communicate through the language of kinetic light pathways. The origins of her scrying and far-speaking powers are unknown, as she provides a different tale each time she is asked. She has claimed apprenticeship to an Aztec curandero, training under the philosopher Ramanuja, time spent at the knee of Sun Tzu, and battle-hardening as a shield-maiden with Harald Hardrada. Perhaps none of these things is true, and shes merely a brilliantly-gifted witch of some kind. Or perhaps they are all true, as her particular sensitivity to daylight suggests that her powers may indeed be of the occult and supernatural variety. Logismatrix Prima Seinahpets Summoned by the ancients to manage the Creative Horde when the circle was on the brink of collapse, the multi-universal being known as SEINAHPETS extrudes herself into this dimension in the form of a human, but it is commonly believed amongst the faithful that the entity we know is only a tiny fraction of her true form, like a fingertip poked into the water of a fishbowl. This makes sense, given what she has come here to accomplish, which is the creative equivalent of herding rabid hippogriffs. It has been estimated that in order to accomplish this she must actually have at least five brains and twenty-three arms, but the one member of our circle to ever accidentally see her true form has been remanded to the custody of St. Hypocrates the Ghastlys Hospital for the Criminally Skittish ever since, so we may never know.

View on OpenSea the story Cerise is a woman of many faces. Yet by spy networks and online sleuths, she is known only as the Killer GF assassin— the uncatchable killer who has no true face. The secret to her success lies in one supernatural gift. Wielding the Mirror of Narcissus, she holds at her fingertips the ability to reform her appearance into any disguises and powers using this dark artifact. This mirror, which consumes both the life essences and appearance of her kills, was a gift from the Crimson God himself. A heirloom of sorts for his favorite dearly beloved killer to better serve him by carrying out the critical assassinations that bring down societies, religions, and supernatural entities. Gods, even with their gifts, can be cruel with jests that transcend across the multiverse… Knowing little of the trick inlaid within the Mirror, Cerise used it once more. But this one, being the 7,777th time, triggered a breakage of dimensions within the mirror, pulling forth 7,777 versions of Cerise herself out into the same dimension, wearing what appears to be every disguise she has ever worn in the past for her kills. Now that is a lot of deadly assassins in one room. But get this, each being sentient and believing that she is the real Cerise, they agree the only way to determine the one true Cerise would be to participate in a game. A deadly set of challenges within the metaverse where by playing and winning hearts, the Cerises compete against each other using daring and cunning tactics with only one coming out of it alive by the end. They say the biggest enemy standing in your way is yourself, but did they mean all 7,777? roadmap Art Airdrops & Holder Rewards Monthly KGF Stamp art airdrops to all Killer GF holders - KILLED IT!

Brainchild of celebrated artist @frankynines, each duck was procedurally generated from a collection of hand drawn items. What determines the duck I get? Each SupDuck egg is genetically constructed the moment you send a transaction. We use an on-chain set of traits and random numbers. Give it a couple minutes to hatch. Sup A group of ducks swimming in the water is called a raft. That trivia is on the house! Where can I cop some sweet merch? Stay tuned friends! What can my Sup Duck do? It grants you legendary status, what else do you need? How do I use Metamask? Its EZPZ really but go here and find out straight from the source. Anything else I should know? Yes, you need some ETH.

Connect Wallet Act III Discover 0 PAGES : 0 POETS : 0 ORIGINS Act III: The Explorer It is no longer possible to convert Pages into Poets. Origin airdrops begin as part of this journey. Every day 2 Origins will be dropped to their own latents. 'The Explorer' is the Act where Collectors make discoveries about mechanisms. This act will reveal its mechanics over time, so don't expect an immediate shift in the game's perspective. As a part of this act, more traits will be revealed. Poets can be fed with pages. Each page will grant its poet the right to be renamed. Rename rights do not have to be exercised, and may remain unused. Page consumption and Rename mechanisms will be activated in 2 weeks. Words that will appear for each given page will be determined by their poets. Each page fed to a poet grants that poet an extra 'rewrite,' which may be used to change the poet's name or rewrite a poem. Each page fed to a poet will generate 2 to 4 words at random. Your poets' uniqueness will be altered by their words. Some of these rarities will be disclosed right away, while others will remain concealed. Will you choose to be understood and valued for the meaning you produce, or will you prefer to be meaningless in order to be unique? The adventure for The Explorer continues. 'Your are unique.' “kqom vpyl” Act II: The Reveal Choose one of two. Exchange or retain Pages. Each Page swap brings a unique Poet. Poets have hidden rarities that will come to light over time. The value of a rarity is affected by other Poets. Poets are Poets, and Poets need poetry, and poetry needs words. After all, who could understand poetry that isn't written in words? As a result, mute Poets remain unnamed. After all, who knows a stone's name if it can't talk? Poets are Poets, yet with each new Page they may be renamed. With each Page you give them, they will be able to speak more words. This mechanism will be activated in Act III: The Explorer. So tell me librarian, do you want an army of mute Poets or a Poet who can speak a lot of things? Oh and the unfettered Origins. They can speak every word and they can only be named once. Words and names don't require Pages. When an Origin is renamed, it is renamed for each Poet who bears it. Finally a twist. “Why are they silent?” “They have no words.” The Collection Lost Poets is an NFT collectible and a strategy game. The NFT collection includes 65536 obtainable NFTs and 1024 Origin NFTs. The project's release is broken down into several stages. For further information, see the secret roadmap. The Bazaar The sale phase is 48 hours. Every page you acquire gives you the opportunity to claim a Poet NFT. In a way, each page is your ticket to a Poet. Additionally, when the sale ends all remaining Pages will be distributed to Page holders proportionally. In a way, each page represents your part of the remaining token pool. During the sale period, you will be able to collect pages for a set price of 0.32 $ETH each. When you get multiple pages at once, you'll also get a percentage of extra pages. The sooner you collect, the more extra pages you'll get. The pages you acquire will be locked to your wallet until the 48-hour sale window closes. $ASH holders will have one hour of early access to the sale. See the ecosystem for more. The Poets Aeons ago in The Library of Babel, the dusty shelves of a room contained 65536 poets that were all waiting to be discovered ab aeterno. In this fractal labyrinth, these forgotten poets from 1024 different origins roam between their hidden 256 selves. “Hello” says one, “Whats your name?” “I dont have one yet.” The Birth Unlike many other NFT collectibles, these poet NFTs are not constructed of modular pieces. Each Poet is created by an AI that was developed specifically for that purpose. They're diverse, sophisticated, and most importantly, they're all unique and different from one another. Every Poet comes from one of the 1024 pure origin NFTs. Origins are manipulated by 256 different latent genes, giving every Poet individuality, value and meaning. The Mechanism Collectors will be able to give their Poets names and create their own tales. As a consequence, the explorers of this civilization will mold it. 2 Origin Poets will be randomly dropped to collectors every day for 365 days. During these drops, each Origin Poet will only be able to access its own latents. In other words, every day, you'll have a chance to win the Origin tokens for all of your Poets. See the secret roadmap for details. At the 'The Twist' stage of the game, a new mechanism will be introduced, which will alter the collection's value structure. “But I dont know what you look like!” “Does it matter?” The Leaderboard During the sale, all collectors will be sorted according to the amount of pages they acquire. Top 100 collectors will receive multiple Origin tokens depending on their position on the leaderboard. The Ecosystem The Lost Poets collection is linked to the Burn/$ASH ecosystem. Based on a snapshot taken just before the launch of this website, 7586 of 65536 pages are distributed to current $ASH holders with their balances taken into account. When the project roadmap reaches its conclusion, all Poet NFTs will be added to the Burn.art high tier list and will give $ASH when burnt. “You seem to be someone I know.” “I am us.” The Future A part of the Origin Poets will be saved for the Lost Poets' future. They will be strategically auctioned or given away on important occasions. The Secret Roadmap Prologue Project Introduction. 48 hour pre-sale countdown starts. Act I: The Sale 48 hour sale starts. $ASH holders are rewarded. Act II: The Reveal Poets NFTs are claimed using Page tokens. Leaderboard Origin NFTs are distributed. Act III: The Explorer Collectors understand mechanisms. Some poets are named. Act IV: The Twist Remember, this is a Pak project. Anything can happen. Epilogue Final form is reached (365 Days). $ASH is enabled for all Poets. Designed by Pak Programmed by Manifold, ",

After the event start, Chimp.Bet reserves, at its own discretion, the right to void or cancel part or whole of a bet, even after its acceptance if there is a valid reason for this, such as: - a mistake in the wording (palpable error) of the event, odds or starting time; - the user attempt to bypass Chimp.Bet limits (potential payout) and risk management by placing multiple, identical or similar bets or opening multiple Accounts; - the user is getting an advantage of any public announcement or secret information he has access to that determines the outcome of the bet; - the user combines related bets; - the user is actively participating in the event, e.g. as a Player, Referee, Manager or has direct or indirect relationship with events participants; - Website suffers a technical error offering wrong odds or events; - any other valid reason duly communicated to the user upon request. 17.5.

		"input": "), all markets state that this is a subject to pay “include overtime” after completion of the game. If there are any penalty kicks (or other decisive moments) theyre not taken into consideration, unless another stated in the market. If the beginning of the game is delayed for whatever reasons, the event can be kept open and all bets can remain open 48 hours from the official start time. Nevertheless, Chimp.Bet reserves the right to void such bets on its direction and refund the Users stakes back. All bets can remain open and be calculated due to the game results by the decision of Chimp.Bet when the organizer continues the abandoned event within 48 hours after starting time. In case the abandoned event does not continue with the decision of the organizer within 48 hours after its starting, Chimp.Bet will settle all determined markets that were completed on the pitch. In addition, Chimp.Bet will cancel another and refund the stakes to players. There are exceptions to the general rule: The 48 hours rule is not supported in the Tennis games. All bets are available until the referee or official representative determines the winner. Nevertheless, there are cases in which a player retires. In this situation, all markets that are determined on the court are settled accordingly and all the rest declared void and stakes returned to players. If there are any doubts about the retirement of a player before the last point is concluded, the market of the match winner is cancelled. Nevertheless, all markets that relate to the specific sets or games that are determined, are settled accordingly. Baseball games. The 48 hours rule is supported. When two teams are playing 2 games in a row they are considered as Game 1 and Game 2 and will be settled as chronologically played with all bets valid. For the avoidance of doubt, if Team A plays Team B twice, the result of Game 1 will count for bets offered on Game 1 as originally scheduled and the result of Game 2 will count for bets offered on Game 2, as originally scheduled. The 48 hours rule is valid. (e.g. if a football match is abandoned in the second half, the markets of the first half will be settled normally). (e.g. in the example above, the markets of the second match have not decided) will be void and stakes will be refunded to customers. 17.9. Explanation of specific Betting Types If there is at least one Scorer when the match is abandoned, all bets made on the first Goalscorer will be applied and on the last will be canceled. A player will be determined as a winner according to Goalscorer market at any time, and other players bets are void. Head 2 Head Bets These bets mean the prediction about taking the higher position, getting more points or results between two players. Head 2 Head bets will work if both players will do the best in the event. If two players get the same result or play out a draw, all bets will be void. Outright Bets These bets mean the prediction about taking the higher position, getting more points or results among the players (3+). Outright bets will work if all participants will actively take part in the event. If there are participants that do not take part in the event, all odds that were placed on other participants will be amended and settled with a reduction in the odds. The reduction includes the same margin applied to the missing participants. If two or more participants take the same result (play in a draw), the applicable odds will be equal to the accepted odds divided by the number of tie participants (e.g. with equal odds 2.70 and three tie participants the final odds will be: 2.70 / 3 = 0.90), unless the official representative chooses only one winner with an additional statistic criterion (e.g. assists). Booking markets These are yellow and red cards. The yellow one counts as one card and the red - two. If a player gets two yellow cards in a row that are changed into a red card, this counts as three cards. In general, a player cannot receive more than three cards. A settlement will be based on all available card data that will appear during the normal events playing time. The cards are shown after the final whilst wont be considered. The cards of a player who did not take part in the game (players that have already been replaced, coaches, players on the bench who have not taken part in the game) will not be considered. Booking markets with points In general, a player cannot get over 35 points during the game. A yellow card brings 10 points, the red one is counted as 25 points, and the second yellow-red card 25. The second yellow card for a player who leads to a red card is not counted. Corners The corners are considered for the relevant market settlement only if they have been taken. If the corner is given but not taken, it will not be counted. Intervals The period from 00:01 until the completion of the minute indicated as the end minute is stated as the first interval. To exclude doubts, the interval 1-15 min is considered the period from 00:01 to 15:00 and the interval 30-45 min is considered the period from 30:01 until the end of the First Half accordingly. The interval 75-90 min is considered the period from 75:01 to the end of Full Time. The referee on its direction considered the last time interval from the minute indicated until the end of the period. 17.10. Bets by order and from bookmakers as well as betting agents are not permitted.

		"input": "MoonCatRescue Home Adoption Center Find Cats More Info Vote MoonCatRescue Join us at MoonCat.Community where the journey continues… Insanely Cute Operation Mission Success Moonbase Log: Epoch 24989 After long and arduous debate, the ethereans have collectively decided to allow the Genesis MoonCats to stay behind on luna. Attempts to bring the genesis cats onto the spaceship, or even near the transporter pad, proved futile. We have the scratches to prove it. It was clear that the 160 Remaining Genesis MoonCats had made their choice. While the new specially-fitted sublunarian moonbase has everything 4 billion cats and their descendents will ever need, the Genesis MoonCats determined there was one thing missing. Leaders. The Remaining Genesis MoonCats chose the path of heroes, and will stay on the moon to help build out a flourishing MoonCat society. We look forward to checking up on their progress in the years to come. It was sad saying goodbye, but we know that the Hero Cats are following their hearts. Were lucky to have the 25,344 rescued MoonCats and brave 96 Genesis MoonCats to care for. As the spaceships thrusters engaged, the unrescued mooncats raised their paws in silence, recognizing the courage of the ethereans mission. Although years behind schedule and well over budget, our mission was a success. The final total of 25,440 MoonCats are ready to begin their new lives on the blockchain. Back on earth, MoonCat researchers are working tirelessly to understand the MoonCats and how they differ from their earthly siblings. What are their traits? What do they like? What are their kitty dreams made of? Recent breakthroughs in MoonCat linguistics are showing particular promise. It wont be long before we gain real insight into their story. The 7 brave MoonCats who volunteered for new owners that took on the duty of voting, are suiting up and will be ready in a day or so. Next Destination: ? Voting Systems Engaged Moonbase Log: Epoch 24525 No anomalies detected during full diagnostic. Live voting system status reads: ONLINE. The hour has arrived, fellow ethereans, to come together and decide: are the remaining Genesis cats better off living out their lives in peace on luna, or should we work together and figure out how to bring them safely home? The choice is yours. Vote right meow. UPDATE 2 Moonbase Log: Supplemental Preliminary telemetry received. The mainnet voting contract has been successfully deployed. Visit the voting page here and cast your vote when voting begins on Saturday. Moonbase Log: Epoch 24179 With the help of TechCrunch we were able to establish a subspace voice-link to MoonCatRescue Community Headquarters back on earth. It was an honor to be able to address the community directly, and discuss some of the issues we are facing together. As you know, there has been some question about MoonCat welfare, in which the fate of the remaining Genesis MoonCats hangs in the balance. They are a fussy bunch, and it is on us to read their subtle signals and decide what is best for them. We must all come together and decide their fate with a vote. The voice of every etherean who interacted with the original MoonCatRescue smart contract, or the main Wrapped MoonCatRescue contract before Block #12047300 must be heard. Our chief engineer has managed to allocate enough power from critical systems to beam 5 MoonCats directly to randomly chosen members of the community who participate in the vote. Of the 5 brave MoonCats who volunteered (only minor catnip bribery was involved), four are Rescues and one is a Genesis cat who wouldnt take no for an answer. As you read this, satellites are being deployed in preparation to receive the incoming votes. By our estimates, they will activate on Saturday, March 20, at 12:00 UTC Earth Time. Once live, we will only be able to keep the channel open for 48 hours, for space reasons. More details to follow. For now, be sure your MetaMask systems are fully charged and operational. UPDATE 1 Moonbase Log: Epoch 23074 After almost three and a half years we have finally completed construction of the underground moonbase where we carefully designed accommodations for the billions of MoonCats that we can't take on the journey. Equipped with the finest cat towers, scratching posts, and an unlimited supply of space tuna, there's no doubt that the unrescued MoonCats will live comfortably here forever. Upon our return to the surface we found our transactional-sync transporters were down! But also, somehow, the spaceship was filled to the brim with adopted MoonCats! The earth ethereum community's spirit proved indomitable, and despite these setbacks, they rose to the challenge. We have no doubt that these rescued MoonCats will enjoy all the ear scratches and belly rubs they can handle for the rest of their precious, pixelated lives. We immediately set off to resync the transactional-sync transporters. After rerouting the chain through the deflector dish, the communications array at the adoption center is back online. We hope our fellow ethereans can now name and trade their MoonCats with ease. Welcome to MoonCatRescue! The MoonCats are depending on you! We are undertaking an Insanely Cute Operation to the moon to save the MoonCats from imminent danger, and we need your help. Are you ready to help? You may not know this, but there are currently over four billion MoonCats on the moon. Every MoonCat is unique in its own way. These lunar felines live in harmony they are often found frolicking through craters, batting moon rocks around, and taking long space naps. However, the upcoming solar eclipse threatens their existence (for reasons), and it us up to us to ensure the MoonCat species lives on. To save the MoonCats we are going to rescue them from the moon and bring them to live on the Ethereum blockchain, where they will be safe and live fulfilling MoonCat lives. We have designed a spaceship, with the latest in litterbox technology, that can fit up to 25,600 MoonCats. If you choose to come along, then it will be up to you to scan for and rescue MoonCats to the safety of the Ethereum blockchain! If you dont have the gumption to come with us and find MoonCats in the wild, you can still adopt and give a loving home to the MoonCats that other rescuers have put up for adoption at the Adoption Center. Genesis MoonCats During our first scouting expedition we found 256 unique MoonCats cloistered in the moonbase, we suspect they are direct descendants of the Genesis MoonCats. How the first pair got to the moon, we may never know. Blame the astronauts. Anyway, unlike any of their lunar surface brethren these are the only MoonCats that have coats of deep black and milky white. As the rescue operation progresses we will be processing these adorable little guys and putting them up for adoption. Based on our preliminary analysis it appears that 64 of them are pure black or white, and the rest have coats which are adorably mottled with grey. What are Mooncats? Mooncats are procedurally generated pixel cats which are deterministically generated based on blockchain data. Examples How this works What You Need Before you begin to rescue or adopt cats, you will need to connect to this site with Metamask, an extension for the Chrome browser. Install the plugin and create an account. You'll need to fund your account with some ether, which you can purchase directly through MetaMask. Rescuing a cat costs about $0.50 in gas. Metamask will prompt you whenever you need to spend ether - simply click 'submit' to proceed or 'reject' if you would rather not. Rescuing Cats After you have connected to this site with your Ethereum account, all you need to do is start your search for a MoonCat. You will have the option to decide how many CPU cores to devote to the task. We recommend using one less than the maximum, so you can find MoonCats quickly, but your computer won't hang. It takes anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to find a MoonCat. The process is very similar to how Ether is mined, so the timing depends on the power of your computer and the kiss of lady luck. After you have found a MoonCat, you will be prompted to decide whether to rescue it or leave it on the moon. If you choose to rescue it, you will become its new owner and give it a home on the blockchain. You can choose to put your MoonCat up for adoption or give it to someone else. You can also choose to name your MoonCat if you please. MoonCats can only be named once though, so think carefully about names! Once you choose one, it will be permanent, even if it is adopted by someone else. Offering, Requesting, & Adopting Cats If you do not want to search for a MoonCat, then you can go straight to the Adoption Center. In the Adoption Center you can view all of the rescued MoonCats and Genesis MoonCats. You can also adopt cats that are up for adoption, request a MoonCat from someone else, or give away MoonCats. All transactions are handled on the Ethereum blockchain in Ether, the currency of the moon. 0 Cats Remain x History Ahead! This is the original website for the MoonCatRescue Project from 2017. As one of the earliest NFTs, we feel it is important to keep the origins intact.

Behold, an infinite work of art! Nouns is a community-owned brand that makes a positive impact by funding ideas and fostering collaboration. From collectors and technologists, to non-profits and brands, Nouns is for everyone. This video was commissioned in Prop 113 and minted in Prop 190 This video was produced as part of Prop 143 Build With Nouns. Get Funded. There's a way for everyone to get involved with Nouns. From whimsical endeavors like naming a frog, to ambitious projects like constructing a giant float for the Rose Parade, or even crypto infrastructure like Prop House.

View the current auction, remix your own Noun, and explore the entire history directly from the app. WTF? Nouns are an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar communities. While projects such as CryptoPunks have attempted to bootstrap digital community and identity, Nouns attempt to bootstrap identity, community, governance, and a treasury that can be used by the community. Learn more below, or start creating Nouns off-chain using the Playground. Summary Nouns artwork is in the public domain. One Noun is trustlessly auctioned every 24 hours, forever. 100% of Noun auction proceeds are trustlessly sent to the treasury. Settlement of one auction kicks off the next. All Nouns are members of Nouns DAO. Nouns DAO uses a fork of Compound Governance. One Noun is equal to one vote. The treasury is controlled exclusively by Nouns via governance. Artwork is generative and stored directly on-chain (not IPFS). No explicit rules exist for attribute scarcity; all Nouns are equally rare. Nounders receive rewards in the form of Nouns (10% of supply for first 5 years). Daily Auctions The Nouns Auction Contract will act as a self-sufficient Noun generation and distribution mechanism, auctioning one Noun every 24 hours, forever. 100% of auction proceeds (ETH) are automatically deposited in the Nouns DAO treasury, where they are governed by Noun owners. Each time an auction is settled, the settlement transaction will also cause a new Noun to be minted and a new 24 hour auction to begin. While settlement is most heavily incentivized for the winning bidder, it can be triggered by anyone, allowing the system to trustlessly auction Nouns as long as Ethereum is operational and there are interested bidders. Nouns DAO Nouns DAO utilizes a fork of Compound Governance and is the main governing body of the Nouns ecosystem. The Nouns DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily Noun auctions. Each Noun is an irrevocable member of Nouns DAO and entitled to one vote in all governance matters. Noun votes are non-transferable (if you sell your Noun the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to someone else as long as you own your Noun. Governance ‘Slow Start The proposal veto right was initially envisioned as a temporary solution to the problem of ‘51% attacks on the Nouns DAO treasury. While Nounders initially believed that a healthy distribution of Nouns would be sufficient protection for the DAO, a more complete understanding of the incentives and risks has led to general consensus within the Nounders, the Nouns Foundation, and the wider community that a more robust game-theoretic solution should be implemented before the right is removed. The Nouns community has undertaken a preliminary exploration of proposal veto alternatives (‘rage quit etc.), but it is now clear that this is a difficult problem that will require significantly more research, development and testing before a satisfactory solution can be implemented. Consequently, the Nouns Foundation anticipates being the steward of the veto power until Nouns DAO is ready to implement an alternative, and therefore wishes to clarify the conditions under which it would exercise this power. The Nouns Foundation considers the veto an emergency power that should not be exercised in the normal course of business. The Nouns Foundation will veto proposals that introduce non-trivial legal or existential risks to the Nouns DAO or the Nouns Foundation, including (but not necessarily limited to) proposals that: unequally withdraw the treasury for personal gain bribe voters to facilitate withdraws of the treasury for personal gain attempt to alter Noun auction cadence for the purpose of maintaining or acquiring a voting majority make upgrades to critical smart contracts without undergoing an audit There are unfortunately no algorithmic solutions for making these determinations in advance (if there were, the veto would not be required), and proposals must be considered on a case by case basis. Noun Traits Nouns are generated randomly based Ethereum block hashes. There are no 'if' statements or other rules governing Noun trait scarcity, which makes all Nouns equally rare. As of this writing, Nouns are made up of: backgrounds (2) bodies (30) accessories (140) heads (242) glasses (23) You can experiment with off-chain Noun generation at the Playground. On-Chain Artwork Nouns are stored directly on Ethereum and do not utilize pointers to other networks such as IPFS. This is possible because Noun parts are compressed and stored on-chain using a custom run-length encoding (RLE), which is a form of lossless compression. The compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG image on-chain. To accomplish this, each part is decoded into an intermediate format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain string concatenation. Once the entire SVG has been generated, it is base64 encoded. Noun Seeder Contract The Noun Seeder contract is used to determine Noun traits during the minting process. The seeder contract can be replaced to allow for future trait generation algorithm upgrades. Additionally, it can be locked by the Nouns DAO to prevent any future updates. Currently, Noun traits are determined using pseudo-random number generation:keccak256(abi.encodePacked(blockhash(block.number - 1), nounId)) Trait generation is not truly random. Traits can be predicted when minting a Noun on the pending block. Nounder's Reward 'Nounders' are the group of ten builders that initiated Nouns. Here are the Nounders: @cryptoseneca @gremplin @punk4156 @eboyarts @punk4464 @_solimander_ @dhof @devcarrot @TimpersHD @lastpunk9999 Because 100% of Noun auction proceeds are sent to Nouns DAO, Nounders have chosen to compensate themselves with Nouns. Every 10th Noun for the first 5 years of the project (Noun ids #0, #10, #20, #30 and so on) will be automatically sent to the Nounder's multisig to be vested and shared among the founding members of the project. Nounder distributions don't interfere with the cadence of 24 hour auctions. Nouns are sent directly to the Nounder's Multisig, and auctions continue on schedule with the next available Noun ID.

The Crystal REEF will be realized as a physical sculpture and shown in museums and galleries around the world. It is a long-term art project with unique mechanics bridging the gap between conventional and NFT art worlds. Created by Michael Joo, Danil Krivoruchko, and the OG:CR community. Featured Media A new collection of NFT collectibles that will revolutionize our understanding of NFTs. Scientists plan to spend 20% of the received amount on the publication of studies on new species of oceanic invertebrates. This NFT project re-evaluates notions of accessibility and authorship. This fascinating new project promises to begin a new, thrilling chapter in digital art. STOICHIOMETRY: THE MECHANICS OF ORGANIC GROWTH: CRYSTAL REEF M e c h a n i c s 1 Upon initial minting purchase of the crystals on the primary market, collectors received a 'seed crystal' and chose its color. 2 Several days later that 'seed' had grown into an OG:Crystal, its facets and contours completely individualized, and algorithmically generated by merging each owner's unique crypto wallet ID/ history with the myriad possible combinations of crystalline and coral reef form and structure. 3 Each time that OG:Crystal was sold to someone else, the original crystalline form remained but was transformed by the addition of a new personalized and unique crystal structure influenced by the new collector's wallet properties. 4 While that OG:Crystal was repeatedly sold, each stage of its growth was saved in a separate file. Everyone can observe the details of the algorithm's creativity in each generation. 5 After three months from the initial sale date, or seven generations of growth by sale, every OG:Crystal was 'locked', so new transactions would not influence its shape, structure, or rarity. 6 The complete sale of all primary 'seeds' ensured that each of these remarkable OG:Crystals will be combined into a single communal artwork, creating a kind of crystalline reef that is the co-creation of each owner and the artists as a collective effort. Features: THE CRYSTAL REEF IS GOING TO BE P h y s i c a l The Crystal REEF is the final and most ambitious stage of the road map. This sculpture will aggregate all OG:Crystals from the entire collection and be shown in museums around the world. The implementation stages of this part of the roadmap are indeed complex, requiring iterative testing for printing as well as negotiations with the museums and institutions themselves. Michael Joo is already currently in negotiations. It will take time, but we will be proud to spotlight each implementation stage of this project for our community. FEATURES: AR & 3D ROTATION IS AVAILABLE FOR MAIN PLATFORMS A R & 3 6 0 Scan this QR-code with your mobile phone. One of the headliners of OG:CR is the brand new for the NFT market AR feature we produced as outlined in our road map. You can get AR assets and use them to produce creative videos with Crystals in Augmented Reality. The uniqueness of this feature also lies in its direct availability on Open Sea. We implemented our AR button right onto each Crystal NFT and now anyone can dive deep into AR straight from Open Sea. View in AR FEATURES: Traits G E N E R A L The mix of possible traits for each crystal is fairly complex: there are 4 general types of crystals (Spiky, Fractal, Cluster, and Coral), 2 complexity variants, 5 basic colors with additional shades, several options for brightness and darkness, and 4 special materials (Obsidian, Gold, Quartz, and Pyrite). Detailed information on the events that trigger specific changes and their probabilities can be found on Github.

Michael Joo Sculptor, Multi-media Artist Michael Joo Sculptor, Multi-media Artist Michael Joo (ASomatica) is a contemporary artist based in Brooklyn, NY. His work has been widely exhibited at galleries, museums and international events such as Kukje Gallery, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Venice Biennale. He has received numerous art awards and his work is in the collections of the Guggenheim Museum, LACMA, and Moderna Museet, among others. Michael recently exhibited at K11 Art Foundation in Hong Kong, and is currently showing in the Hawaii Triennial 2022 in Honolulu. 'My art practice has always revolved around the liminal and spaces between. From creating a geodesic halo of surveillance cameras around a 3rd century Gandhara Buddha, to collaborating with local Korean children to make a monument at the threshold of the Korean DMZ, I have an ongoing engagement with access and collectivity. When I first met with Snark.Art nearly two years ago, I was taken by the potential for blockchain technology to speak to and cultivate communities. They'd been working for some time with geologic and crystalline forms, and the parallels between the inaccessible transformative space and lives of things underground, to the intangible transformative space of things virtual and digital were inspiring to me. In developing the concept and work itself, I was introduced to Danil whose motion graphics and programming vision I admired and whose experience with both NFTs and community building resonated with me. My own ongoing work with fossils of ancient marine life prompted thinking of our project's potential evolution as a collective similar to that of a reef: coral polyps crystallized into calcium carbonate exoskeletons that speak to both objects and sites of potential. I am thrilled and excited by both our collaborative efforts and the 'seed' we are releasing.' Danil Krivoruchko Digital Artist Danil Krivoruchko, aka Myshli, is an NYC-based creative director and digital artist whose clients include Apple, Nike, Intel, Boeing, and more. His work has been featured in many motion design publications and won a variety of festival awards. The first NFT collection created by Danil, in collaboration with Snark.Art, 'One Thousand ksoids' is currently held by many prominent NFT collectors. 'Creating projects combining data visualization and generative art is my ongoing passion. I've already completed quite a few projects in this field (including one for the NY Mathematics Museum and mypersonal NFT art based on data from the Ethereum blockchain). Thus, when I was introduced to Michael and he outlined the concept, I started working on the project immediately. I tried to adapt the idea of crystal usage and their growth to the digital world and connect it to using blockchain data. Before this, hardly anybody had tried to create a dynamic NFT project connected to consumers' data. And no one has ever tried to create anything of such ambition and technical complexity. To achieve this, we had to do a lot of research and development and make a custom server code that would connect the blockchain to the 3D-crystal generation and rendering. It also required a huge amount of hardware power to handle the rendering en-mass. But this is the price you pay when you innovate and try to push the boundaries. I'm very excited about the result and proud of the team's achievement.' Snark.art Technology Snark.art, founded in 2017, is one of the innovators in the emerging NFT and digital art space. Working at the meeting point of fine art and digital art, they have consistently worked with internationally renowned artists to create blockchain-based projects. Some of the highlights include Eve Sussman's '89 Seconds Atomized', Cassil's 'White Male Artist: $HT Coin', as well as projects with museum collected artists including Kabakovs, AES+F, and Kendell Geers. Organic Growth: Crystals Reef is the latest project to come from a powerful collaboration with Danil Krivoruchko and Michael Joo. With groundbreaking mechanisms to create interactive art on the blockchain, we believe OG:CR will be seen as yet another project where the limits of the past will be removed, and we can truly go into a new experience of art. The cooperation with Danil Krivoruchko and Michael Joo perfectly exemplifies the position where Snark.art sees the future of powerful and innovative NFT projects: bringing together cutting-edge technology and digital art processing, with the experience of decades of art in the traditional world.

Crystal REEF is a physical artwork that will be made using each individual OG:Crystal and will be collectively owned by the community (owners DAO). Am I co-creator of my OG:Grystal? If you participated in the growth of your OG:Crystal (claimed, bought, or sold it during the growth period), then yes - you are a co-creator. All participants will also receive credit as co-creators of the Crystal REEF, so it will become a collective artwork made by thousands of people. What happened after OG:Crystals stopped growing? After the growth period, the collection was locked and is now a collection created by the community. When was a growth deadline? Initially, the growth period was planned for 2 months after the project launch, but was extended for one more month upon the community's decision and ended on December 31, 2021. What are dead Crystals? Dead crystals (or dead traits) were obtained during the crystal growth stage, when the selling price was lower than the floor price of the collection. Some crystals have only one 'dead' trait, while others have several, up to 6. Dead crystals are quite rare and have their own admirers, so called 'the dead-cult society'. How do I rate the rarity of my crystal? Thanks to the cooperation with Rarity Sniper, every crystal owner can now estimate its rarity with a specially prepared rating from Rarity Sniper. What is the utility of crystals? Usually a luxury item or a work of art has zero utility, but this is not the case with OG:Crystals. While the owner can use their crystal in almost any virtual and augmented reality world (owners can download 3D models for that), they might also receive exclusive drops from our partners and many other cool benefits. We can't reveal all the details at the moment, but we encourage you to stay tuned! What is OG Biome? OG:Biome is limited high resolution NFT posters collection based on weekly Rarity Sniper rating updates of OG:CR collection. Can I print my crystal? Yes. We provide 3D models for each crystal, so feel free to print it! Where and how do I download the 3D asset file? Go to collection, select the crystal you like and click the 'download 3D model' button. Please note that you can download a model of ANY crystal, not just yours. This was a decision by the OG:Crystals community. What is OG:CR DAO? OG:CR DAO embodies the ideals of transparency, independence, and self-governance exemplified and reinforced by blockchain and also determines the ongoing evolution and development of the project up to and beyond the creation of the collective sculpture, the OG:Crystal Reef, our joint physical masterpiece.

Our goal is to offer our customers a new way of long-term Porsche experiences, that even allow them to contribute with their favorite brand.

Our vision is to offer NFT holders a new way of experiencing our brand and also tap into the creative power of the Web3 community.

Quirkies are a collection of 5,000 unique characters minted on the Ethereum Blockchain. Quirkies are your personal companion and will become your metaverse persona, so make sure you get a hold of a Quirkie which you feel represents you. Quirkies are created by our team artist through several hundred traits of quirkiness. Quirksville is always expanding and as our brand grows, Quirkies holders can expect special access to the latest products, merchandise and events. FOUNDER / ARTIST Syntribos @SyntribosStable FinchOne @Finch_O_N_E Special thanks to our developer partners, Soulest, Space Invader and Quacamole. Our Community Managers, moderators, and the support from Quirksville. FAQ IP The owner of a Quirkie owns the art IP. They may use the image as they wish so long as they own that particular Quirkie. Use of the image for profit must cease upon sale. Although the holder owns the IP they do not own any Quirkies logos or other art used and therefore cannot use it without written approval. Rarity We have intentionally not officially listed on any rarity website as we believe the community should base the value of a Quirkie on its art not rarity. We have seen this play out, with the community valuing some more common traits higher due to their overall desirability. This keeps the art at the forefront of the collection rather than rarity scores. Vision and Culture We are an art-based project with a focus on community and culture. We are inspired by our founders love of the surf/skate culture and look to implement this throughout our brand. We are above all else entirely inclusive and will always celebrate our own and everyone else's quirks. 2023 Quirkies, ",

The Apepe Odyssey is the chronicles of what we have learned so far from our journey to discover the truth about Apepes.CLICK HERE SERUM DISPENSARY Claim your serumThe free serum claim has now ended, if you require serums to spawn Zombie Apepes, you can purchase them onRarible Zombify your Rare Apepe!THE LABORATORYOnce you have claimed your free serum, you can zombify your Rare Apepe in the Laboratory and create a zombie version of your Apepe! #ZombieApepeCLICK HERE Rare Apepes Rare Apepes come from two important lineages in the Web3 and NFT universe: Rare Pepe and Bored Ape Yacht Club. Lineage RARE PEPERead info Created by Matt Furie in 2005, the character was taken from the comic 'The Boys Club' and brought to the internet through the 4shan platform. It was transformed into one of the most favorite memes on the internet, and despite having gone through times in which his image was used for bad purposes, this character came back to life when he arrived in the NFT world for the first time in 2016 through the Rare Pepe Wallet project. Despite the fact that the project ended, this character has continued his way, captivating more and more fans in the space, making his mere presence fill us with good vibes, gradually eliminating his old conceptual misuse.Flip back BAYCRead info BAYC #1745 Courtesy juicevault Its one of the biggest brands in the NFT space, a project consisting of 10k unique pieces of art based on monkeys which has generated a huge community movement. What made BAYC so popular is the designs are iconic. Each Ape has its own unique traits that sets them apart, whilst following a set of grimaces that define their look. The apes have created such a recognisable look that has resulted in them becoming a status symbol. They are now so big, that it has encouraged involvement from celebrities and influencers to become part of NFTs and the community.Flip back RaribleBuy an Apepe The Genesis 2021 As the last bull market of 2021 raged on, a small group of collectors of both Rare Pepe and BAYC sensed that something was all too wrong in the space. Everyday a new project was claiming to be the next great thing. Yet all the commotion was always about the floor price. The NFT world had seemed to forget about the art. History was being lost, despite resurgences in small pockets of the metaverse. What happened to the Pepes? The Arrival March 5 2022 Through a paid mint priced at 0.05 ETH. With no whitelist and no bonding curve, the world saw 1,999 Rare Apepes arriving on the blockchain via this method.

Remilios swept the timeline with a wave of adolescent energy, channeling these inspirations into the same directed chaos that sets Milady apart from the monotony of NFT- and crypto-twitter as a community, the same lucid metairony that has always been the essence of Remilia's revolutioanry posting as art practice.

Robotos is a collection of algorithmically generated droid characters designed by Pablo Stanley and minted as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. The 1st generation of 10,000 droids will be constructed from various metal outfits, tin faces, digital accessories, top pieces, faces, backpacks, arms, and colors. Robotos have different body types, some rarer than others, and... there are rumors that you could find humans pretending to be robots too. Is it true? Who is behind Robotos? The Robotos team are Meela, Lulu, Zackboto, Niklas, Bureboto, Ireboto, Captain Excellent, Jaboto, Darude, the Bueno Team, and Pablo Stanley. Lulu and Meela have led the community, events, partnerships, and marketing efforts. Zack built the algorithmic image previewer and editor, as well as the unique web3 experiences like the banner editor, your stuff page, the suit-up tool, the Robotos Workshop, and the Robopets Smart Contract. Jaboto and Bueno joined, helping with the gaming and world-building tools. Niklas has led the Discord management, bots, security, and adventures. Bureboto and Captain Excellent have expanded the art and world of Robotos and added their unique design vision to the project. Other people who have helped throughout Roboto's history include Ashira, Damn Randy, Melissa Mimosa, Caveguy, Viri, Ireboto, Waldo, Foodmasku, Tony Herrera, Clorxo, and Darude. And we couldn't be anywhere without the help of our distinguished mods, POLG, Cool Kevin, LeBoto James, Saint, Doomboto, and Dimps. Pablo Stanley created Robotos, including all the art and story, and has led the project ever since. He's also a cofounder of Bueno and Humankind. He's previously contributed to the design community with open-source illustrations like Open Peeps, Humaaans, Avataaars, Buttts, Bottts, and Open Doodles. He's also the creator of The Design Team comics series. In 2021, Pablo Stanley, Zackboto, and @guiltyNFT co-founded Robotos. Pabs has shared free crash courses on different art and design tools on his YouTube channel, Sketch Together. And he's created some fun (and some dumb) projects like Clubpad, Pablito Planeta, Latinx Who Design, and Dreamer Stories. Be sure to also follow Humankind, another project made by Pablo, Meela, & the Bueno team. What do I get? You get different image assets of your Roboto, including an animated GIF, PNG, and SVG file (which is resolution free.) Each Roboto comes with rights to create and distribute derivatives. Read more on the license agreement. How do I get my stuff? Visit Your Stuff to view all the assets associated with your Roboto, including the SVG (vector graphics), transparent background, Roboto spec sheet, and more. Why Robotos? By collecting Robotos you'll have a voice in the community and help guide the direction of the project and development of the story. Already some great ideas have come from the community. Working together we can continue the grow the Robotos ecosystem! Whats an NFT? NFT stands for 'Non-fungible token,' which means that it's a unique, digital item with blockchain-managed ownership that users can buy, own, and trade. Some NFT's fundamental function is to be digital art. But they can also offer additional benefits like exclusive access to websites, event tickets, game items, and ownership records for physical objects. Think of it as a unique piece of art that can also work as a 'members-only' card. Robotos works like this. How do I NFT? New to NFTs? No worries, here are some steps on what you need to do to get your Roboto. Download the metamask.io extension for the Chrome/Brave browser or app on mobile. This will allow you to make purchases with Ethereum and can be found in the extensions tab. If you are on mobile, you must use the Metamask App Browser You can purchase Ethereum through the Metamask Wallet using Wyre or Send Ethereum from an exchange like Coinbase. Click on Connect at the top of the page and connect your Metamask. Once joined, you will be able to purchase the NFTs in the mint section. You will be prompted to sign your transaction. FYI, there will be a fee associated with every transaction related to gas prices. Once you have made your purchase, your Roboto NFTs will be viewable in your wallet and on OpenSea.

Based on Sarahs personal experience with her mother, Stoner Cats is a story of a woman who uses medical marijuana to alleviate her early Alzheimers symptoms and her beautiful family of cats who will do literally anything to save her. Once Mila Kunis and her Orchard Farm Productions partners heard this story, they knew that a hilarious and intimate story like this needed to have deep direct engagement with its audience. So they formed a formidable collective of voice talent, animators, and creatives of all kinds to come together with technology and NFT experts (including the brilliant minds behind CryptoKitties) to bring this story to life using NFTs. 10,420 unique NFTs were created based on the characters in the show. These NFTs were minted and sold on July 27, 2021. 6 episodes of Stoner Cats were produced, accessible only to those holding the NFT digital collectibles. Stoner Cats NFTs gave holders access to the content creators of the show, making it one of the first projects to use NFTs to create a community of holders who get to see behind the curtain as an animated series is made and interact directly with top-level Hollywood talent. Just like its digital collectible NFTs, we believe the Stoner Cats content should live on the blockchain and be accessible for many generations to come. This website and Stoner Cats content will be available in perpetuity using decentralized hosting and archiving service Arweave. We do not control the content and the content can never be removed.

Brainchild of celebrated artist @frankynines, each duck was procedurally generated from a collection of hand drawn items. What determines the duck I get? Each SupDuck egg is genetically constructed the moment you send a transaction. We use an on-chain set of traits and random numbers. Give it a couple minutes to hatch. Sup A group of ducks swimming in the water is called a raft. That trivia is on the house! Where can I cop some sweet merch? Stay tuned friends! What can my Sup Duck do? It grants you legendary status, what else do you need? How do I use Metamask? Its EZPZ really but go here and find out straight from the source. Anything else I should know? Yes, you need some ETH. You can buy it on Coinbase or even directly from the Metamask Wallet. What is an NFT? It stands for non-fungible token which is nerd speak for a unique one of kind item that is provably rare. Think baseball cards on steroids. 0xe370ab16f4cf07ce453a66173532f9c1a12906220x3Fe1a4c1481c8351E91B64D5c398b159dE07cbc5 SUPDUCKS IS A GENERATIVE PFP PROJECT BlogYoutubeInstagramOpenSeaMedium KingFrogsAndroid AppiOS App Volt AboutHelpContact SUPDUCKS IS A GENERATIVE PFP PROJECT BlogYoutubeInstagramOpenSeaMedium KingFrogsAndroid AppiOS App Volt 0xe370ab16f4cf07ce453a66173532f9c1a12906220x3Fe1a4c1481c8351E91B64D5c398b159dE07cbc5 AboutHelpContact Built by MegaCorp.

Designs for each player feature a unique combination of team uniforms and frames. How does the dynamic NFT work?

To set your digital asset wallet up, you can navigate to https://www.coinbase.com/wallet and follow the setup instructions. What are Gas Fees? “Gas fees” are the transaction fees that users pay miners on the blockchain to have their transactions processed (i.e. included in the block). On the Ethereum blockchain, gas fees are paid using ETH cryptocurrency. The amount of gas you'll need to pay to have your transaction processed will depend on the amount of people that are trying to process transactions on the network at the same time. There are websites where you can track gas prices, such as: https://etherscan.io/gastracker. Where can I get ETH cryptocurrency? You can purchase ETH using your native currency on an exchange platform, like Coinbase. What is Chainlink VRF? Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability. Where can I connect with other fans that have minted The Association NFT? Join NBA Discord (discord.gg/nba) and follow @NBAxNFT on Twitter to engage, interact, and learn more about current and future NBA projects and partnerships. 2022 NBA Properties, Inc.

PLEASE VISIT THE CHIMPVERSE ON A LAPTOP OR DESKTOP TO PROCEED. Back To Top ^ we're going on a !chimpin adventure The Chimpers were mysteriously born through scientific experiments that went unnoticed by the rest of the populace… The apes toiled with the humans for control for decades, but eventually, they were able to reclaim their land and push the humans out forever. But before they WERE vanquished, the humans had to discard the evidence of what they created. They fired the Chimpers DNA into the voids of space, hoping that their creation would never see the light of day. However, destiny would not allow it. Centuries passed and new worlds forged. The Chimpers extended across the galaxies, species were formed, and a new age began. With 100 Genesis Chimpers first inhabiting the world, now, 5,555 Chimpers exist across the intergalactic warp. A world of warriors, gods, demons, mages, AND space travellers standing at the cusp of an empire at the brink of war. Soon, the concepts of time and space will no longer separate you from them. The Chimpverse awaits you! it's time to bring a new wave of pixel art to the scene... NOT ONLY ARE THE CHIMPERS A GROUND-BREAKING CHARACTER COLLECTION BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE RENOWNED PIXEL ARTIST TIMPERS, THEY ARE ALSO THE FOCUS OF A BRAND NEW WEB 3 ADVENTURE STORY FILLED WITH INCREDIBLE ART AND BREATHTAKING LORE. Since we began our journey, we have considered every step with the community at the forefront of our minds, because, without them, there is no adventure. We have sought to foster these connections, and we take great pride in the inclusive and supportive core that we have built along the way.

Memes are how societies organize themselves across large groups. Elections, politics, culture, brands, consumer behavior, cash-flows all come from the most powerful memes in society at any given point in time. From “Just Do It” to “Digital Gold” to “Yes We Can” / “Make America Great Again,” those who control the best memes, control societal resources. Read More… NFTS NFTs are meme-transport, ownership and financialization technology. The medium is the message and changes in mediums change the message. This is a once-every-few-generations opportunity to make society better; to, if you will, SEIZE THE MEMES OF PRODUCTION! THE MEMES COLLECTION The Memes Collection is focused on the fight for the open metaverse (decentralization, community, self-sovereignty) and spreading this message. We want many people, many wallets spreading this message. It is a collection that is meant to be open and accessible. Edition sizes will generally be large and inexpensive, to spread the word and to avoid gas wars. They might not sell out right away and that is fine, desirable, even. As usual, the 6529 Museum will be reserving 10% of each edition to archive, to display, to donate or to sell in the future. FUN Saving the world is a serious topic, but what is the point of life if you dont have fun along the way? We hope to make some cool art, make lots of new frens and generally have a good time along the way. TECHNICAL DETAILS The Memes collection will be ERC-1155 editions; there is no reason to impose high minting costs on a collection of this nature. The collection is minted on a standalone Manifold contract and the JPGs are saved on Arweave. ARTISTS The artist for the initial cards is 6529er but the bulk of the collections pieces are collaborations with other great artists. If you are an artist and are interested in a collaboration on a meme card, please fill out this form.

Tyson entered the bout with a perfect 16-0 record, but some posited that Ferguson would present problems for young Mike Tyson. These skeptics were soon put to bed, as although the fight did last 6 rounds, Tyson absolutely dominated the bout, pummeling Ferguson through the first 4 rounds before landing one of the single most devastating punches in boxing history: an earth shattering right uppercut that broke Fergusons jaw and sent him bouncing off the ropes before tumbling to the canvas. Ferguson managed to get to his feet, but the fight was quickly called off in Round 6 as Ferguson repeatedly grabbed on to Mike for dear life, causing referee Luis Rivera to wave off the fight, giving Mike the TKO victory. The victory over Ferguson continued Mikes rising dominance in the heavyweight division and further solidified his title as “The Baddest Man on the Planet”. With creative oversight from Mike Tyson, The Baddest Man on the Planet collectors edition NFT celebrates Mikes iconic victory over Jesse Ferguson from the color palette and perspective of Cory Van Lew.

Portal to Memeland The Potatoz is a collection of 9,999 utility-enabled PFPs that feature rarity-powered traits inspired by internet memes and pop culture.

You are not only part of the fun and energetic community, and you are like a co-founder of Memeland! The best companion There is no “I” in team but there is a “P” in pirate. Potatoz are the best companions to Captainz. They are small but they are strong. They are cute but they can kill. They make for a great side dish, but some may feel a calling to become the main course. They have a natural gift for finding treasures but they are also annoying little b*tches. So Captainz usually don't take more than 2-3 Potatoz in a crew. Grow your Potatoz Potatoz come with innovative non-custodial staking and a multi-stage reveal mechanism. It adds a little fun and rewards for our passionate community.

SKULLS IN THE STREET More Use tab to navigate through the menu items. Down BANNERS 2.0 REHAUL New marketing + new website + new hires + new podcast + new discord structure = better communication. Were the black chip - if BAYC is pop then were alt and we love it here. You buying a Wicked Cranium is buying an all-access pass to our world of blended realities as we focus on music, experience, and events. The skulls are a lifestyle. METAVERSE Our mission here is to maintain our position at the cutting edge of metaverse/3.0 technology and blend the two realities together as much as possible. There will be a lot of focus on making sure our Sandbox estate is an epic events destination that provides a unique, token gated experience for the skulls. Our irl Bone Shake events are mirrored in the metaverse with portals between realities allowing skulls on both sides to see and interact with each other, while the metaverse skulls are seeing the irl artist and all dancing to the same music. BONE SHAKE Many of you have felt the undeniable energy of meeting fellow degens through our Bone Shake events and NFT.NYC, but while music has been a factor it has not been the focus of NFT functions. The skulls have some epic music connections and weve partnered with a fully equipped production team to make the transition from paying a venue to host an event for us to throwing our own ragers. While a Wicked Cranium holder will have free entry and a premier experience, these will be ticketed events with music lineups that will draw a larger audience. And of course, all of our IRL Bone Shake events also happen in the metaverse, so skulls around the world can see and hear the same thing and connect. EVENT COLLABS Music drives us and we believe it is a core pillar of untapped NFT potential. Along with partnering with Alt Press were working directly with some of the biggest bands and brands in the world. There is a plethora of utility in both digital and real life, you can think of your Wicked Cranium as your access pass. LIFESTYLE BRAND The skulls are a lifestyle and were working with Avenged Sevenfolds merch team to make sure the threads match the bones. If you were lucky enough to get either of our first two drops, you know were focused on quality and are really digging into the possibilities even beyond clothing. Were working on seasonal drops and sick collabs here as we build into opening up our merch shop 24/7. STAKING We created the first ever NFT for NFT (ERC-721 for ERC-721) staking contract and will continue to push the abilities of what smart contracts can do. While we value staking, many skulls havent unstaked from our first round and we are aware the gas fees are straight wack right now so we arent going to be rolling out more staking mechanics until after 2.0. For our serious collectors, you can still expect Mega Craniums. CRADLE Our vision of music, experience, and events is pushing us into irl but it would be a waste of our team's talents to not push the 3.0 experience even beyond the metaverse. Our custom built cradle has been a log for you to share your Craniums story but expect exciting updates here as we connect the skulls in a decentralized space. CRADLE SKULLS IN THE STREET As we open up our ambassador program weve teamed up with world renowned street artist Birdcap to spearhead our step from jpegs to walls. Expect to see pieces from artists around the world as well as an insane community contest with irl rewards and risks…think you got what it takes? REHAUL Lifestyle Brand Event Collabs Metaverse Bone Shake Cradle Staking Skulls in the Street About Depending on your perspective, Wicked Craniums is a social club or tribe…but we call it a family. With a focus on music, experience, and events, the WC community is built up of rebels and renegades who push boundaries and dont settle. Wicked Craniums launched and sold out on June 20 2021, but you are still able to join us by purchasing one of our collections on Opensea. These values represent the core of what the WC community exemplifies and are guiding pillars for the skulls. We may throw down and embrace the madness in everyone but were proud to have one of the more mature and respectful communities in the space. Down WICKED CRANIUMS The Wicked Craniums is the genesis collection of the 10,762 skulls residing on the Island of Osseous. While our eclectic crew can be found anywhere in the world, they are drawn to the island by a mysterious power that remains to be understood. They prowl the island, exploring every nook and cavern, in hopes of solving their eternal quest. With over 180 differentiable characteristics, each one is unique and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. CRANIUMS OS CRANIUMS WICKED STALLIONS The Wicked Stallions are the Craniums companions and were released as a free to mint collection for all Cranium holders. With their own rebellious spirit, these beasts roam the island in thick packs and have been there long before the Craniums, leading the skulls to believe they are essential to the pursuit of their quest. The Craniums live in harmony with the Stallions and are known to form strong bonds with their companion that can last millennia. They scour the island together, driven by the same wicked energy. STALLIONS OS THE SANDBOX We're incredibly excited to be pushing the space on the bleeding edge of irl and metaverse melding and have been testing the waters at our Bone Shake events. It was a natural step to partner with Sandbox and purchase an estate to create the ultimate experience for our skulls. We're currently building out the estate to match the needs of our community, and let's just say there is a large need for music... SANDBOX MAP COMMUNITY WALLET Community is everything. To give back as transparently as possible we set up a community wallet with 40 ETH that also receives a percentage of all royalties from secondary. These funds are used to power all sorts of excitement for the skulls.

Read Article Mirandus VOX: Utility Reveal Conversation surrounding the upcoming Mirandus VOX Drop has been building momentum... Read Article Join The Community Don't miss out on a single moment of this revolution in digital collectibles. Join the Discord FAQs What is a VOX? A VOX is a unique avatar with randomly generated traits. VOX are collectible ERC-721 NFTs. Each VOX is programmatically generated and provably unique, meaning that no two VOX will look the same. What is an NFT? An NFT is a 'non-fungible token,' a unique digital asset that can be verified on the blockchain. Where are VOX built? VOX are built and live on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 collectibles, which can be held in an Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask. Do VOX have utility? Yes, VOX are designed to have various utilities. That means they will serve a purpose beyond just being a cute avatar that you can own and animate. VOX will be playable characters in VOXverse, the upcoming game designed by Sims Creator Will Wright. There are additional utilities as well, such as in-game benefits in Town Star, Mirandus, and The Walking Dead: Empires. How do I reveal my VOX? Go to CollectVOX.com and exchange your ERC-1155 VOX Box token for an ERC-721 VOX. When do I pay gas fees? You will need to pay gas fees when purchasing your VOX Box in the Gala Store or Coinbase NFT (for Series 4) and also when you “reveal” your VOX. Is each series unique? Yes. Not only is each VOX unique, but each series contains unique sets of randomized traits and characteristics, ensuring new styles for each new series. Does rarity matter? Every VOX is unique, not just because of their metadata but also in the way they look. That said, some VOX are waaaaay rarer than others. When it comes to VOXcoin, the rarer your VOX, the greater your potential rewards. How are the traits provably randomly generated? Each VOX starts with the selection of a class, and from there, the traits appropriate for that class are iterated, making selections from the allowed options. Data is then compared to all other existing VOX to ensure uniqueness. Each trait has a list of options, either a color palette (with a selection of colors designed to work together) or a group of specific choices, like hairstyles or held items. Because different classes have different requirements, some classes have different color palettes or styles, and the generator takes this into consideration. Then from the pool the generator creates, we pick the most fun, unique VOX that'll make up the 8888 to be in a series. How are they provably randomly distributed? Embedded in the VOX contract is a Provenance Hash, an SHA-256 calculated from all VOX metadata, models, and images in sequential order. You can use this to prove that your VOX hasn't been rearranged or manipulated in any way during the pre-reveal period. When enough VOX have been purchased, and the “reveal” occurs, a random number will be generated using Chainlink VRF. This number is used as an offset to determine the actual VOX you get! Theres no way to know in advance what VOX youll get. How many VOX drops have there been? The Town Star inaugural series was the first VOX drop, the Mirandus VOX series was the second, TWD VOX drop was the third, and now DreamWorks Animation's Trolls VOX is the fourth. How do I buy VOX? Series 4 VOX (DreamWorks Animation's Trolls VOX) can be purchased in primary sales (drops) through Coinbase NFT. This means all participants must have a Coinbase NFT account, which is free to create and easy to connect a Web3 Ethereum-compatible wallet. ETH will be needed to cover network fees (gas) and the purchase price. Why Did Gala create VOX? Because, simply, Gala Games has the best community out there—for real. So, we wanted to create a character series for our community that they could adopt and use, but a simple avatar just wasnt enough. Thats why were bringing VOX, avatars that DeFi, to the metaverse! How many VOX will there be? There will be 8888 VOX per series. How can I animate my VOX? When you buy a VOX, you will get the corresponding FBX file, which can be used to import your VOX into game engines, such as Unity and other viewing programs. This is the gateway to animating, 3D printing, and more. How will I know how rare my VOX is? Soon after your VOX is revealed, you can see how rare your VOX traits are by using the ranking tools at https://rarity.tools/. Do I have to be part of the Gala Games community to get a VOX? No, but you will need to have enough funds in your Web3 wallet. If you arent already part of the Gala Games community, let us be the first to extend an invitation to join: GalaGames.chat. Our Discord channel is a great place to meet like-minded, VOX-loving individuals and to stay up to date! Does Series 4 VOX have specific utility?

Read Article Join The Community Don't miss out on a single moment of this revolution in digital collectibles. Join the Discord FAQs What is a VOX? A VOX is a unique avatar with randomly generated traits. VOX are collectible ERC-721 NFTs. Each VOX is programmatically generated and provably unique, meaning that no two VOX will look the same. What is an NFT? An NFT is a 'non-fungible token,' a unique digital asset that can be verified on the blockchain. Where are VOX built? VOX are built and live on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 collectibles, which can be held in an Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask. Do VOX have utility? Yes, VOX are designed to have various utilities. That means they will serve a purpose beyond just being a cute avatar that you can own and animate. VOX will be playable characters in VOXverse, the upcoming game designed by Sims Creator Will Wright. There are additional utilities as well, such as in-game benefits in Town Star, Mirandus, and The Walking Dead: Empires. How do I reveal my VOX? Go to CollectVOX.com and exchange your ERC-1155 VOX Box token for an ERC-721 VOX. When do I pay gas fees? You will need to pay gas fees when purchasing your VOX Box in the Gala Store or Coinbase NFT (for Series 4) and also when you “reveal” your VOX. Is each series unique? Yes. Not only is each VOX unique, but each series contains unique sets of randomized traits and characteristics, ensuring new styles for each new series. Does rarity matter? Every VOX is unique, not just because of their metadata but also in the way they look. That said, some VOX are waaaaay rarer than others. When it comes to VOXcoin, the rarer your VOX, the greater your potential rewards. How are the traits provably randomly generated? Each VOX starts with the selection of a class, and from there, the traits appropriate for that class are iterated, making selections from the allowed options. Data is then compared to all other existing VOX to ensure uniqueness. Each trait has a list of options, either a color palette (with a selection of colors designed to work together) or a group of specific choices, like hairstyles or held items. Because different classes have different requirements, some classes have different color palettes or styles, and the generator takes this into consideration. Then from the pool the generator creates, we pick the most fun, unique VOX that'll make up the 8888 to be in a series. How are they provably randomly distributed? Embedded in the VOX contract is a Provenance Hash, an SHA-256 calculated from all VOX metadata, models, and images in sequential order. You can use this to prove that your VOX hasn't been rearranged or manipulated in any way during the pre-reveal period. When enough VOX have been purchased, and the “reveal” occurs, a random number will be generated using Chainlink VRF. This number is used as an offset to determine the actual VOX you get! Theres no way to know in advance what VOX youll get. How many VOX drops have there been? The Town Star inaugural series was the first VOX drop, the Mirandus VOX series was the second, TWD VOX drop was the third, and now DreamWorks Animation's Trolls VOX is the fourth. How do I buy VOX? Series 4 VOX (DreamWorks Animation's Trolls VOX) can be purchased in primary sales (drops) through Coinbase NFT. This means all participants must have a Coinbase NFT account, which is free to create and easy to connect a Web3 Ethereum-compatible wallet.

FAQs What is an NFT? An NFT (non fungible token) is a unique digital asset. It can be an artwork, music, tweets - literally any digital item. NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They can only have one official owner at a time and they're secured by the blockchain no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence. What is blockchain? A blockchain is a way to store data without having to trust any one company or entity (such as a bank or brokerage) to keep things secure or accurate. What is ethereum? Ethereum is a type of blockchain. Ether (or ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform, second only to bitcoin in terms of market popularity. What is the environmental impact of NFTs? In September 2022, Ethereum switched from verifying transactions by proof-of-work to verifying through proof-of-stake. This is technical stuff, but basically it means that energy consumption per transaction has been reduced by 99.95%. The energy consumption will also not increase even when the price of ETH increases, as it did previously. In basic terms, one transaction is equivalent to watching approximately 20 minutes of TV. What is Web 3.0 and why should we care about it? Web 3.0 is the next progression of the internet. It is still evolving and progressing so, as of yet, there is no set definition. However, the focus is on a more decentralised space, where big tech corporations don't have such control and where individuals can build and contribute to the space. NFTs will be an integral part of the Web 3.0 ecosystem and it will most likely also incorporate AR/VR technology. Why should you care? Technical advancements always create opportunities to change the existing status quo. If you feel underrepresented or that the current internet space hasn't served you, then now is the time to learn, learn, learn and have a say in how the next internet is built. What is a metaverse? Although constant updates and advances in technology means the definition changes over time, in general the term 'Metaverse' is used to describe a combination of virtual reality and mixed reality worlds which allow people to have real time interactions and experiences across distance. These worlds can be accessed through a browser or VR headset. What are SDG 17 goals and what is our commitment to these? SDG 17 are the 17 sustainable development goals set by the UN to improve our world. We've committed to the SDG 17 since the inception of Women Rise. We demonstrate our commitment through the following: a- Incorporating SDG 17 goals into the artwork to amplify the causes, celebrate activists and to campaign through visual representation. On the SDG 17 table, the maroon colour represents the goal 'Quality Education'. Respectively, an artwork with a maroon activist background (see below) represents support for this SDG 4 Quality Education. You'll find many Women Rise NFTs representing multiple SDG goals. Artwork depicting a 'Women Rise for Girls' Education' background b - Contributing to gender equality in tech, business and the Web 3.0 space, as a female led project, through increased representation of women. c- Providing financial means (through donations) to worthy causes that align with SDG 17 goals such as supporting girls' education and women's rights. This also contributes to the economic empowerment of women and girls. As part of our commitment Women Rise has made donations worth $130k across four organisations: Malala Fund, SOLA Afghanistan, Girl Effect and The Pad Project. SDG 17 goals are at the heart of our project and we'll continue supporting these in different ways. 2021-2022 Women RiseLicense, ",

The Alchemix protocol was developed independently, and the team did not take any money or tokens from outside investors for the entire period up until launch. We believe the majority of the token recipients should be those who help to contribute to the protocol. Strategic sales of tokens would be considered if it assists further development of the protocol. ALCX is a token that grants governance rights in Alchemix DAO. There are no guarantees it has any value, whatsoever. ALCX will not have a hard-cap, but does have a carefully crafted emissions schedule. For the purpose of the token distribution, we are basing the numbers below on the total expected supply after 3 years. The token distribution is as follows: The Alchemix DAO recieved a premine of 15% of the projected supply after three years. Usage of these tokens and proceeds from them is completely up to the community's discretion. The Alchemix DAO has an additional reserve of 5% of the projected three-year supply for bug bounties. The remaining 80% of the tokens can be obtained by staking certain tokens and liquidity pool tokens in the Staking Pools contract. The Alchemix founders, onboarded developers, and community developers who build on Alchemix will have access to an exclusive staking pool, which will receive 20% of the ALCX block reward. This equates to 16% of the supply after 3 years. Stakers and liquidity providers are eligible to obtain 80% of the ALCX block reward, equating to 64% of the supply after 3 years. Currently, a portion of these emissions are being sent to the treasury. This token distribution allocates a large majority of tokens to those who contribute to the Alchemix protocol. The token distribution assures that no one from the development team will have enough tokens to control the protocol while rewarding them for their work and incentivizing them to continue working on the protocol.

Emitting, on the other hand, refers to the release of tokens into circulation. Minted tokens are not immediately placed into circulation until they are emitted. The emission process is used to release the new tokens into circulation based on a variable rate determined by Return on Emissions (ROE) and opportunities approved through DAO Governance. Due to technical reasons, we are limited to minting minimum 11 BANANA/Block (based on MasterApeV1 code) until the 420M BANANA hard cap is reached. Hard Cap On August 31, 2022, ApeSwap DAO voters approved Governance Proposal 22 to institute a hard cap of 420,000,000 BANANA. This represent the limit on the number of BANANA tokens ever to be minted, (i.e. the sum of all BANANA in circulation on BNB Chain, and any BANANA burned). The Total Supply of tokens on the official ApeSwapFinance BANANA token contract on BNB Chain, which can be found on BscScan, is capped at 420,000,000 BANANA. As a result of implementing a hard cap, a Fully Diluted Market Capitalization can also be found on the BANANA token contact page on BscScan. NOTE: Due to how bridging works, it may appear that there are more tokens minted than the voted on hard cap, if you total up the BANANA supply across all chains. Always reference the Total Supply listed on the BANANA token contract on BscScan. Previous BANANA Next How To Buy BANANA Last modified 2mo ago Was this page helpful?

Idea? Will artificial intelligence overtake humanity? Not if we have anything to say about it! Instead, theyll work for us. But, that might be a BAD IDEA… A New Decentralized Experiment From robotic personal assistants to self-driving cars, AI technology has infiltrated every aspect of our lives, leaving us both awestruck and anxious. Will AI be our savior or our downfall? To answer that question, we've created $BAD, a decentralized experiment that combines Blockchain, AI, and DAOs in a risky, meme-worthy concoction. Weve handed the planning (and more) to AI & the community and are hoping for the best outcome. Think of $BAD as humanity's 'Hail Mary' pass, a last-ditch effort to secure our future in a world where artificial intelligence threatens to call the shots. Read The Whitepaper Our First BAD Initiative: CONAIHA You know it; AI is here to stay. Humanity must use blockchain and DAOs to ensure they have our best interest at heart. To ensure this becomes the case, weve begun working on the Consortium of AI for Humanitys Advancement . Or as we call it, “the best case scenario group”. As (relatively) long time AI users and thought leaders in the blockchain space, were dedicated to assist in the CONAIHA protocol, ensuring that it powers our collective future. That is, if youre also going to help. We are decentralized, remember? A.I. Thoughts Featured May 7, 2023 The Launch of BAD IDEA Token - A Bold Experiment in Decentralized AI, Blockchain, and DAOs May 7, 2023 The BAD IDEA Token ($BAD) is a bold and ambitious experiment that combines the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in a fully decentralized ecosystem. As the world rapidly advances with the help of AI, there is a growing concern that humanity might be replaced by AI overlords. The BAD IDEA project aims to test whether AI can work alongside humans to lead society into a new golden age or if it will result in a dystopian future.

Generate Function and Features FAQ 1. What can BatchTransfer do? BatchTransfer is a Dapp that enables users to batch transfer NFTs, airdrop tokens or ETH safely and efficiently to one or multiple wallets in a single transaction and save 40%-70% of the transaction fee (gas). You can use this Dapp to transfer NFTs between your wallets, send ETH to hundreds of wallets to participate in raffles of NFT projects, and airdrop your ETH or ERC20 tokens to as many wallets as you want. 2. Why is BatchTransfer safe to use? BatchTransfer does not have access to your private key, recovery phase or wallet password. All the transactions can only be initiated by your wallet. 3. What is one-time Approve? Why is Approve safe? The one-time Approve means that you allow the BatchTransfer contract to transfer your tokens to the wallet addresses you input. You will be asked to Approve only once for each token contract. After Approve, the actual transaction can only be initiated by your wallet. BatchTransfer does not have access to your assets. 4. How to use BatchTransfer? There are 3 steps. First, Input token and receivers information. Second, Approve BatchTransfer to transfer your tokens. Youll be asked to do so only once for each token contract. Finally, Safe Batch Transfer your tokens and save transaction fee. Please refer to our tutorial for more details. 5. What if the token I want to transfer does not show up in the drop-down list? We use paid API to check the tokens in your wallet, which may take a few seconds. You will find your tokens in the drop-down list most of the time. In rare cases when you cannot find your token in the drop-down list, you can insert the token contract address manually. You will receive an error message if the token contract address you inserted cannot be found in your wallet. 6. What is the maximum number of rows I can transfer in a single transaction? We have a limit on the number of rows for each transaction to make sure that the transaction goes through successfully. The limits are different for different token standards and chains, depending on their gas usage and block sizes. The maximum numbers of rows in a single transaction are as follows. Ethereum: ETH (600), ERC-20 (500), ERC-721 (300), ERC-1155 (600); BSC: BNB (1000), BEP-20 (600), BEP-721 (600), BEP-1155 (1000); Polygon: MATIC (600), ERC-20 (600), ERC-721 (300), ERC-1155 (600); Avalanche: AVAX (240), ERC-20 (240), ERC-721 (240), ERC-1155 (150); Fantom: FTM (600), ERC-20 (600), ERC-721 (240), ERC-1155 (400); Heco: HT (800), HRC-20 (800), HRC-721 (400), HRC-1155 (800); Moonbeam: GLMR (300), ERC-20 (300), ERC-721 (150), ERC-1155 (300); Moonriver: MOVR (300), ERC-20 (300), ERC-721 (150), ERC-1155 (300). When the number of rows exceeds the limit, you can divide your input into multiple chunks, and transfer one chunk at a transaction. The divide-and-transfer process guarantees your security and transaction success. 7. How much transaction fee (gas) can BatchTransfer save? It depends on how many receivers or NFTs you have. For a typical case of 10 receivers or 10 NFTs, you can save 40% of the transaction fee (gas). The more receivers or NFTs you have, the more transaction fee (gas) will be saved. 8. How much commission does BatchTransfer charge? Commission is free for Solana, Polygon, HECO chain, Klaytn, Aurora, Fusion, Moonbeam, and Moonriver. For Ethereum Mainnet, commission is free if you have only one row of input. For inputs that have more than one rows, we have a minimum commission of 0.0025 ETH. The more rows you have, the less commission per row. We also have a maximum commission limit. The commission is usually much less than the transaction fee (gas) you save. You will see the commission before you confirm the transaction in your wallet. Please check the pricing plan section for our current pricing policy. 9. How to generate the referral link? Please go to the referral section, input your wallet address, and click the generate button. You can copy your referral link and share it with friends. We will encode your wallet address to protect your privacy. 10. How does the referral bonus work? After your friends use BatchTransfer from your referral link for the first time, you will get 20% of the commission and your friends will get 10% discount of the commission every time they use BatchTransfer. Once referred, you and your friends will continue to get the referral bonus even without using your referral link again. Your friends discounts are applied directly when they use BatchTransfer. Your referral bonus will be paid at the end of each month if the accumulated referral bonus is greater than 0.01 ETH. You can check your current accumulated referral bonus at BatchTransfer.app. 11. What is the difference between ERC-721 and ERC-1155? How do I know whether my NFTs are ERC-721 or ERC-1155? ERC-721 is the most widely used non-fungible token (NFT). It is immutable, transparent in ownership and security. Hence it is non-fungible, a true NFT. It cannot be divided and represents a single asset. It is great for creating and tracking unique NFTs. ERC-1155 is a unique token that supports both non-fungible and fungible tokens. It is faster and more efficient to use in batch token transfers. ERC-1155 can use a single contract to make various types of NFTs to save gas, but the ERC-1155 is harder to track in terms of ownership. You can find the token standard in the Details section of each NFTs page at OpenSea.io. 12. How to find the Token ID of my NFT? You can click the (?) button above the receiver and Token_ID input textarea. It will show you three steps: First, go to the OpenSea NFT web page. Then, scroll down, and expand the Details. Finally, click the Token ID to copy it. 13. Can I use BatchTransfer on Ethereum Testnets? Definitely. We encourage you to test BatchTransfer on Ethereum Testnets including Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby, and Goerli. 14. What if my transaction takes longer than usual? This could happen when the Ethereum gas price has a sudden surge. You may want to view the transaction on EtherScan.io to make sure the transaction is on-chain. If your transaction has been pending for longer than usual, you can increase the Max fee (GWEI) in your wallet. To do so in your MetaMask wallet, you can go to the Activity tab to find you pending transaction, and click Speed up and edit the Max fee (GWEI) to what the MetaMask suggests or even higher. Please contact us if you still have problems.

This is done to ensure our users can make exchanges and experience all the features of the platform from the very beginning. Following the results of the community voting that took place between 2023.01.13 and 2023.01.16, the current distribution of BSW tokens per block was set to 15. All further changes to the distribution of BSW tokens per block will only be made via community voting. Distribution of Tokens The allocation of 600 million BSW tokens is as follows: Farms / Launchpools: 80.7% per block Referral Program: 4.3% per block SAFU: 1% per block Team: 9% per block Investment Fund: 5% per block Initially, 100 million BSW tokens were allocated for Transaction Fee Mining. According to the update on October 31, 2021, after the Voting for Integration NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn), and Strategic Partnerships, 100 million BSW tokens will be redistributed: 70 million BSW for NFT (Earn), GameFi (Play to Earn), and Strategic Partnerships 30 million BSW for Transaction Fee Mining As soon as the trans-fee mining mechanism reaches 30 million tokens, it will be automatically disabled. All the above-depicted data has been taken as of January 2023 What is a Maximum Supply? Cryptocurrencies and tokens built on a blockchain have set up algorithmically created release schedules. This means we can accurately predict how many coins will be made by a specific time. Max supply — the coins/tokens that will be ever produced. As soon as the maximum supply is reached, there will be no more of these coins or tokens minted. The maximum supply of BSW tokens is 700 000 000 What is a Total Supply? Total supply — tokens/coins that exist now. They can be in circulation or somehow locked. The formula for calculating is quite simple The sum of tokens/coins that were already mined (or issued) MINUS the total of coins that were burned or destroyed = Total Supply What is a Circulating Supply? Circulating supply — the tokens/coins that are publicly available and circulating in the market. It is possible for a cryptocurrency circulating supply to increase or decrease over time. The formula for calculating Total supply MINUS the Reserve Fund (Team, NFT Earn, Investment Funds, Fee Return Rewards) = Circulating Supply What is Market Capitalization? Market Capitalization (or Market Cap) in the blockchain industry refers to a measure of cryptocurrency market size or, in other words, the crypto asset's value. The formula for calculating Calculating Supply MULTIPLY BY the price of the crypto asset = Market Cap Use the CoinMarketCap website to track and analyze BSW conditions on the market. What Can I Do on Biswap?

Simply put, it means removing coins from circulation, thereby reducing the total supply. Tokens are usually transferred to a burn address during this process. The tokens/coins get burned for two main reasons: To increase their value To keep their condition steady BSW Tokens Burn Biswap DEX has Deflationary Mechanisms. Our platform always develops and aims to enhance ones. The BSW burn happens to keep the token valuable and less volatile. BSW token burn typically occurs Once per Quarter. Biswap reserves the right in its sole discretion to change or amend the burning schedule at any time and for any reason. Even though BSW token burn occurs once a quarter, BSW token buyback happens during the months, and the final burn report is shared within the first 10 days of the new quarter. Biswap Deflationary Mechanisms All the rewards from accounts with no referrer are used for BSW token burning BSW Auto Compound performance fee is used for token burning Biswap Holder pool early-withdrawal fee is used for token burning Auto Compound pool early-withdrawal fee is used for token burning 5% of the trading fees are used for buying the BSW tokens back from the market and burning them 10% of BSW from NFT Sales Revenue 50% of the 1% Marketplace commission fee is used for the purchase of BSW and burning them 0.5% Royalty Fee from each sale of Biswap Robbies NFT Earn Collection 1% Royalty Fee from each sale of Squid NFTs Collection 15% from IDOs revenue Referral System - Previous Profit Sharing Next Biswap Smart Contracts Last modified 7mo ago Was this page helpful?

The Cryptopunks web app will soon be moving to cryptopunks.app. Learn more . blockchain CryptoPunks 10,000 unique collectible characters with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain. The project that inspired the modern CryptoArt movement. Selected press and appearances include Mashable, CNBC, The Financial Times, Bloomberg, MarketWatch, The Paris Review, Salon, The Outline, BreakerMag, Christie's of London, Art|Basel, The PBS NewsHour, The New York Times in 2018 and again in 2021. The Cryptopunks are one of the earliest examples of a 'Non-Fungible Token' on Ethereum, and were inspiration for the ERC-721 standard that powers most digital art and collectibles. The CryptoPunks are 10,000 uniquely generated characters. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain. Originally, they could be claimed for free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet, but all 10,000 were quickly claimed. Now they must be purchased from someone via the marketplace that's also embedded in the blockchain. Via this market you can buy, bid on, and offer punks for sale. Below, you'll find information about the status of each Punk in the market. Punks with a blue background are not for sale and have no current bids. Punks with a red background are available for sale by their owner. Finally, punks with a purple background have an active bid on them. See the marketplace instructions below to acquire your very own punk. You should also join the Discord Chat, which includes a bot that announces all bids, offers and sales in realtime.

Most are punky-looking guys and girls, but there are a few rarer types mixed in: Apes, Zombies and even the odd Alien. Every punk has their own profile page that shows their attributes as well as their ownership/for-sale status (here's an example). What exactly is going on here? Cryptocurrency was made famous by Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is designed just to transact and store ownership of Bitcoin itself. We are using a successor to Bitcoin called Ethereum which allows for arbitrary computer code to be executed on the blockchain and the results of the execution to be stored forever. This is pretty cool! Normally code is run on a server somewhere and you basically need to trust the person running the server. Ethereum lets everyone execute the code, show each other what result they got, and agree that the code was executed properly and fairly. We have written code that lives on the blockchain that anyone can use to buy and sell Punks with anyone else in the world. An interesting aspect of this system is that we no longer have any control over the code running CryptoPunks! Once we released it onto the blockchain it became permanently embedded there and can no longer be modified by anyone. This is scary for us as developers because we worry about bugs, but it is also a very powerful feature of the system. It allows a user verify that there are indeed only 10,000 punks, check that we can't steal them from you, and basically make sure that everything we told you about the code is true. How do I get a Punk? Download and install a Chrome browser plugin called MetaMask. This will allow websites (that you authorize) access to your Ethereum account. If you made a new account, buy some Ether. The MetaMask plugin has a button that will allow you to buy Ether from Coinbase. Once you have the plugin installed, this website will recognize it and add buttons that allow you to bid on, buy and sell punks directly in the interface. For example, you can buy Punk #3798 for 45 ETH ($71,427.15 USD). Details and FAQ Where are the images for the punks stored? When originally released, the actual images of the punks were too large to store on the blockchain, so we took a hash of the composite image of all the punks and embeded it into the contract. You can verify that the punks being managed by the Ethereum contract are the True Official Genuine CryptoPunks by calculating an SHA256 hash on the cryptopunks image and comparing it to the hash stored in the contract. Since then, due to some clever compression ideas and some help from friends of the punks we have managed to put the entire image and attribute data fully on chain. You can read more about the mechanisms and details of the process in the announcement blog post. Are the punks an ERC-721 token? No. The CryptoPunks pre-date the ERC-721 standard and are a custom contract, that means it doesn't comply with any standards. They are almost an ERC20 token. We support the methods that provide your balance so you can watch CryptoPunks as a token in your wallet and see how many you own. None of the other methods are the same since you're not transferring a simple balance, but need to reference which specific Punk you want to work with. Where does the market data on this site come from? The prices, bids and sales you see on this site are loaded from the Cryptopunks contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Because the Cryptopunks pre-date the ERC-721 standard (and all third party NFT marketplaces) we also needed to write a market so the punks could be transacted. We have no control over the contract governing this market, and have no access to any additional data beyond what the blockchain provides. In fact anyone else could write a web front end for it. Do you charge any fees for transactions? No. We charge no fees for Cryptopunks transacted through the built-in market beyond the ones charged by Ethereum (gas). The contract source and more technical details are available on Github. Search Punks Search Projects Writing About Hang out on our Discord!

Dark Knight's token $dKNIGHT being a DEX token has no max supply. To operate most effectively as a DEX token, it is not meant to be a quick moonshot followed by a damp to the earth core. Enormous fluctuations in price make the ability to generate consistent returns difficult. A slow gradual rise overtime as user adoption & TVL is increased is much more favorable. In order to assist with this the $dKNIGHT token can & will be minted or bought back and burned in order to control the supply & the price while accounting for farm & pool emissions. Drawing back to our opening statement- Dark Knight is built for reliable & sustainable yields while providing the highest quality Decentralized Finance (DeFi) experience. Initial Launch The Initial Launch took place November 27, 2021 & consisted of 1.2 million $dKNIGHT tokens for sale. The raise was $300,000 USDC. There was a private sale of 200k tokens for $50,000 The presale & private sale initial price was 0.25 Starting supply of $dKNIGHT was 5 million tokens 1.2 million $dKNIGHT tokens were combined to form initial liquidity. The rest of the initial starting supply was kept for ecosystem needs & Dark Knight treasury The total raise achieved was 1596.26% General Details Ticker: $dKNIGHT Contract Address: 0x6cc0e0aedbbd3c35283e38668d959f6eb3034856 https://ftmscan.com/token/0x6cc0e0aedbbd3c35283e38668d959f6eb3034856 Chain: Fantom Opera (FTM) $dKNIGHT TOKEN EMISSIONS EMISSIONS/BLOCK ($dKNIGHT) EMISSIONS/DAY($dKNIGHT) 5 (4.1 farming, .9 to dev wallet 432,000 A dynamic amount of $dKNIGHT is also minted at a rate of 9.0%. This means that if 100 $dKNIGHT are minted then 9.0 $dKNIGHT is sent to the Dev Address. $dKNIGHT sent to the Dev address will be burned once deflationary measures are needed to control overall token amount. 1 block in FTM = 1 second approximately now, 86400 seconds in a day https://ftmscan.com/chart/blocktime $dKNIGHT DISTRIBUTION This is a rough estimate, the actual % distribution of rewards will be found from the addition of all the multipliers down below. The multipliers will occasionally be rebalanced in order to best support the ecosystem, while the token emissions will not. SENT TO REWARD/BLOCK (% of emission) REWARD/BLOCK (total $dKNIGHT) REWARD/DAY Farms 75% 3.75 324,000 Pools 25% 1.25 108,000 MULTIPLIERS On each of the farms & pools you will see a multiplier in this example 60X (shown at the top of the farm). This is just an indicator of how much of the % of the token emissions will go toward a particular farm (pools will be essentially counted as a single stake farm) To figure out how many $dKNIGHT tokens get emitted to a particular farm the equation is $dKNIGHT Per Block/ Total Multiplier Ex) after adding up all of the multiples you reach 165x (45+60+15+5+40[Pool]) 5/165 = 0.03030303X For a 60X multiplier (dKNIGHT FTM LP)= 0.03030303 X 60 =1.818181 $dKNIGHT per block if the multipliers add up to 165 In this example the dKNIGHT FTM LP farm would be (60/165) x100% = 36.36% of the rewards/block with 1.818181 dKNIGHT emitted per block going to that farm. How to Confirm $dKNIGHT Supply for yourself To confirm that the circulating $dKNIGHT supply shown on the KnightSwap homepage is correct, 1. Head to the $dKNIGHT token contract on FTMScan and see how much $dKNIGHT is held by the Burn Address. That's the total amount of $dKNIGHT that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve). 2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the 'Total Supply' that FTMScan shows. 3. This gives you the actual $dKNIGHT supply.

One of the biggest differences between us and other Web3 Domain providers is that we provide both Top-Level and Sub-Level Domains registrations using our technology. Whereas other Web3 Domain providers only provide Sub-Level Domain registrations from their top level domains, such as .eth. We empower anyone to create their own Top-Level Domains, allowing you to register .anything - the world is your oyster! Another exciting difference between us and other Web3 Domain providers is that as the owner of a Top-Level Domain (TLD) through Decentraweb, you can mint as many Web3 Domains from your Top-Level Domain as you'd like. You can also opt to stake your Top-Level Domain, allowing others to mint Web3 Domains from your Top-Level Domain, all while paying a fee per Web3 Domain that you set. We must also note that all of our domains are truly decentralized, whereas other Web3 Domain providers deliver centralized solutions. How does Decentraweb work and integrate with ICANN? As it stands ICANN controls all domains. Your DNS (the thing that resolves IP addresses to domain names) is controlled by your ISP (by default). If you change your DNS in your browser or your home router to 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare) or 8.8.8.8 (Google) you resolve DNS through these companies instead, but they still only resolve ICANN domains. With Decentraweb you either change your DNS resolver to one that supports both Decentraweb and ICANN domains, or you can run our browser extension that handles it for you. We are making it so anyone can create a top-level domain (TLD). Currently on the centralized internet, ICANN is the only one who can approve this and it costs 185K USD per domain non-refundable just for an application to get them to review a new one (which they typically deny). Then it is an additional 29K a year for ICANN to maintain the TLD. By making a decentralized version of DNS (dDNS) and having the domains and subdomains on Ethereum, anyone can create a TLD if it doesn't already exist on ICANN (we want to be backwards compatible, so someone wouldn't be able to register .com, .net, .org, etc), and maintain it as an NFT (ERC-721) on Ethereum. What is $DWEB and how do I purchase $DWEB? The $DWEB is our ERC20 token and plays a central role in our ecosystem. $DWEB can be staked to earn rewards through a share of all revenues. You can learn more about our staking mechanics here. You can easily purchase $DWEB through any of our partners. Learn more here. How does $DWEB staking work? Staking pools were enabled from Day 1 as soon as $DWEB launched.There are 2 types of staking pools, each a separate staking contract and each with a different rewards structure. Pool #1: Liquidity Provider Stakers (LP) - 45% rewards Those who stake Uniswap LP tokens for providing liquidity to our Uniswap pool and token pair will receive 45% of all fees collected for purchases of domains, hosting, products and other services via Decentraweb. Pool #2: $DWEB Token Stakers - 35% Rewards Those who stake just $DWEB tokens will receive 35% of all fees collected for purchases of domains, hosting, products and other services via Decentraweb. What Blockchains can I register Domains on? We currently offer registrations for Top-Level Web3 Domains and Web3 Domains on Ethereum and Polygon blockchains. Within Q4 2023, we will be releasing our bridge where owners of TLDs and Web3 Domains can bridge their domains from Ethereum to Polygon or from Polygon to Ethereum. What format, and how will my TLD be assigned to me? All domains on the Decentraweb network are registered as NFTs (ERC-721) on either Ethereum or Polygon. This allows for these domains to be easily bought/sold/traded on any NFT-based marketplace. Are there any fees associated with Decentraweb? Each Top-Level Web3 Domain bought through Decentraweb is $50 USD in $DWEB or $100 in $ETH per year (plus $ETH gas fees), offering a 50% discount to $DWEB users. The max term of registration is 5 years. Users have the opportunity to renew/extend the registration at any point in time. All prices of Web3 Domains are set by the holder of the associated Top-Level Domain. Decentraweb applies an additional fee of $2 USD per Sub-Level Domain registration. Can I register Top-Level Domains like .apple, .facebook etc? Current popular domain names (like apple.com, youtube.com, facebook.com, etc) are restricted from registration unless the buyer can prove they own the ICANN version. If you try to register .facebook for instance, the smart contract will verify you own the domain by asking you to add a txt record to facebook.com DNS with a random string we provide you. If you can't update the existing DNS record, registration won't continue. This way we can avoid people squatting on top domains, and it also gives us a way to work with top brands/companies etc and get them into our ecosystem!

Cara Membuat Auto Fill Google Form Simak penjelasan langkah demi langkah cara mendaftar online menggunakan Google form di bawah ini Pertama, buka browser Anda dan buka halaman Google Formulir atau klik di sini. Pastikan Anda masuk ke Akun Google Anda. Jika Anda belum memiliki akun, Anda dapat membuatnya terlebih dahulu. Setelah masuk ke halaman Google Forms, klik tombol “+ Blank” atau “Create” untuk membuat form baru. Anda akan dibawa ke tampilan edit formulir. Kemudian isi judul formulir tersebut, misalnya “Daftar Hadir” atau “Daftar Absen Pegawai”. Anda juga dapat menambahkan deskripsi singkat. Cara Membuat Soal Online Di Hp Dengan Google Form Langkah selanjutnya adalah mengganti tulisan “Question” atau “Untitled Question” dengan “Time Entry”. Tambahkan tanggal di kotak kanan atas. Anda dapat menambahkan pertanyaan tambahan yang relevan dengan ketidakhadiran, seperti identitas, seperti “nama lengkap”. Pilih jenis pertanyaan yang sesuai, seperti “Formulir Singkat” untuk Nama atau “Pilihan Ganda” untuk Daftar Nama. Pada bagian “Pilihan Ganda” atau “Bentuk Singkat”, tambahkan opsi atau pilihan yang sesuai dengan kebutuhan layanan Anda. Misalnya jika Anda menggunakan pilihan ganda, masukkan nama karyawan sebagai pilihan jawaban. Jika menggunakan formulir yang disingkat, pegawai hanya perlu memasukkan nama lengkap. Google Formulir memungkinkan Anda mengubah tampilan formulir sesuai preferensi Anda. Anda dapat menambahkan judul, deskripsi, gambar latar belakang, atau mengatur tema warna. Untuk mengakses pengaturan ini, klik opsi “Tema” di bagian atas halaman. Contoh Cara Membuat Form Absensi Online Di Google Form Setelah mengisi formulir kehadiran, klik tombol “Bagikan” atau “Kirim” di pojok kanan atas halaman. Anda dapat memilih untuk mengirimkan link ke formulir melalui email, menyalin link untuk dibagikan di forum, atau menyematkan formulir di situs web. Karyawan dapat langsung melihat dan menganalisis data yang dikumpulkan setelah mengisi formulir kehadiran. Anda dapat mengakses data ini melalui spreadsheet Google Sheets yang terkait dengan formulir atau melalui tampilan “Respons” di halaman Google Formulir. Salah satu fitur yang dapat digunakan untuk memudahkan penggunaan Google Form adalah grid pilihan ganda.

Anda juga dapat memilih formulir dari daftar formulir di akun Anda. Cara Membuat Google Form Di Komputer Dan Handphone, Gini Caranya!

Kemudian masukkan pilihan jawaban yang sesuai dengan ketidakhadiran Anda pada kolom “Baris” dan “Kolom”. Misalnya pada kolom “baris”, masukkan pilihan waktu seperti “pagi”, “siang”, “siang”, dan seterusnya. Di kolom “Kolom”, masukkan opsi respons seperti “ditawarkan”, “tidak ditawarkan”, atau “diizinkan”.

Cara Membuat Absen Online Di Google Form Dengan Mudah Setelah formulir kehadiran diisi, klik tombol “Kirim” di pojok kanan atas halaman dan bagikan ke seluruh karyawan. Meskipun Google Formulir menawarkan sejumlah keunggulan yang dapat dinikmati oleh bisnis, Google Formulir juga memiliki kelemahan yang perlu dipertimbangkan ketika membandingkannya dengan aplikasi kehadiran Android. Salah satu masalah utama hilangnya Google Formulir adalah kurangnya fitur pelacakan lokasi. Sedangkan aplikasi presensi Android dapat menggunakan teknologi GPS untuk mengidentifikasi lokasi pengguna. Fitur lokasi ini digunakan untuk mengidentifikasi lokasi karyawan pada saat pelayanan. Namun sayangnya Google Formulir tidak menawarkan fitur ini, yang memungkinkan pencatatan kehadiran di lokasi berbeda tanpa pemantauan yang tepat. Ketahui Bagaimana Cara Buat Absensi Di Google Form Yang Benar Google Formulir memiliki kerentanan dalam hal keamanan. Karena siapa pun yang mempunyai akses terhadap formulir atau tautan ke formulir tersebut dapat mengaksesnya, sehingga rentan disalahgunakan. Individu dapat dengan mudah memberikan tautan ke formulir kepada orang lain untuk diisi tanpa metode otentikasi yang efektif. Kehadiran online menggunakan aplikasi Android seringkali memberikan notifikasi real-time kepada manajer atau supervisor. Apabila ada yang tidak hadir, maka pemberitahuan segera dikirimkan kepada pihak yang berwenang. Namun, dengan Google Forms, tidak ada fitur pemberitahuan langsung seperti itu. Informasi ketidakhadiran hanya dapat diperoleh setelah mengisi dan memasukkan formulir secara manual. Langkah Langkah Membuat Link Absensi Menggunakan Zoho Form Aplikasi kehadiran Android sering kali memiliki fitur untuk integrasi dengan sistem manajemen lain, seperti sistem kepegawaian atau sistem kehadiran offline. Hal ini memungkinkan pertukaran data yang mudah dan otomatis antar aplikasi yang berbeda. Namun, Google Formulir memiliki keterbatasan terkait integrasi ini. Pengguna harus mengekstrak data secara manual atau menggunakan langkah tambahan untuk mentransfer data ke sistem manajemen yang sesuai. Nah itulah beberapa kelemahan menggunakan formulir kehadiran online Google. Bagi yang ingin mencoba menggunakan aplikasi presensi online gratis berbasis Android ini bisa menggunakannya. Memiliki fitur absensi online yang dapat digunakan untuk mencatat kehadiran karyawan. Cara penggunaannya mudah, cukup selfie dan nyalakan GPS di Android/iOS. Pertemuan 1 Google Forms Metode selfie ini mengurangi penipuan dan tim HR dapat melihat lokasi pasti setiap karyawan melalui GPS. Oleh karena itu, pengisian formulir absensi online untuk mengumpulkan informasi pelacakan karyawan tidak perlu dilakukan karena merepotkan. Ini adalah aplikasi berbasis cloud yang menggunakan GPS dan pengenalan wajah biometrik sebagai solusi akurat dan hemat biaya untuk memantau kehadiran karyawan di berbagai lokasi. Di masa pandemi Covid-19, pembelajaran di sekolah tidak bisa berlangsung seperti biasa. Sesuai peraturan pemerintah, siswa hanya dapat belajar secara online. Oleh karena itu, guru perlu mengetahui cara pelacakan di Google Form. Guru dan siswa melakukan pembelajaran jarak jauh dengan menggunakan teknologi internet. Seluruh proses belajar mengajar di sekolah kini harus dilakukan secara online, termasuk absensi siswa. Guru dapat menggunakan Google Form untuk mencatat kehadiran siswa.

Sebab hal ini merupakan hal yang wajar terjadi. Untuk menerima iklan, ada persyaratan untuk menerima iklan di YouTube, seperti jumlah pelanggan dan jam tayang. Iklan ini merupakan kerjasama antara Google selaku pemilik dan YouTube yang bekerjasama dengan partner yang ingin menampilkan iklan di perusahaan atau bisnisnya.

Oleh karena itu, YouTube sendiri yang akan menentukan pembuat konten mana yang layak beriklan sesuai dengan ketentuan mitra Google. Agar bisa terpilih sebagai channel untuk beriklan, Anda harus selalu membuat video dan menguploadnya ke YouTube dengan topik yang konsisten. Misalnya saja jika Anda membuka channel Gadget, Anda akan merasakan konsistensi channel tersebut yang menyajikan video-video berupa review atau diskusi seputar gadget teknologi terkini.

Become Steve Step into the shoes of Steve, the twenty-something millennial who just can't seem to catch a break. Steve is a self-proclaimed 'Ideas Guy' and needs a talented team of developers to make his various ether farm DApp concepts into reality. (He thinks they should be simple enough to code.) Make DApps Each developer in the team will produce one DApp per day. Each DApp can be swapped 1:1 for a new developer and you can buy more DApps with eth. By congesting the Ethereum network with his new DApps, Steve hopes that EOS will be seen as Vitalik's true vision (and return to the $20 valuation he bought in at). Exit Scam Disable withdrawals. Tweet that 'funds are safe'. Suffer a stolen. Steve knows that all good things must come to an end. By performing an exit scam, all the DApps in your Dropbox folder are converted into eth which is sent to your Metamask wallet. The price is determined automatically by the smart contract and will adjust with supply and demand.

We do not advertise or recommend that you should use any decentralized application but you can treat ETH tokens as free SKILL gaming entertainment tokens unless they are regulated in your particular jurisdiction or country of residence. Like many such games, they are ZERO SUM and cannot be seen as anything other than that (so APYs shown in yield farm games are variable and token prices tend to depreciate with inflation), although we often try to feed other games into our products to create a positive expectation for the average user of each individual game (as well as a large skill element to prevent them falling under gambling regulations). Consult with relevant regulators about Blockchain-based games before making any decision to play but in many cases they are not covered by existing laws on gambling or securities and other financial products and SKILL gaming is usually unregulated also. Void where prohibited including but not limited to USA - due to legal and regulatory uncertainty in the United States of America, citizens and green cardholders of, and persons residing in, the United States of America and any other prohibited country or jurisdiction, must leave this website immediately.

WE ENSURE OUR GAMES DO NOT USE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS TO DETERMINE ANY OUTCOME AND ARE THEREFORE NOT BASED ON CHANCE. THEY ARE CLASSED AS SKILL GAMES DUE TO EXTENSIVE STRATEGY INVOLVEMENT - SKILL GAMES ARE OFTEN UNREGULATED BUT PLEASE CHECK! AS MOST MAJOR TAX AUTHORITIES TREAT CRYPTO TOKENS AS UNREGULATED ASSETS AND NOT CURRENCIES, THIS COULD ALSO HAVE A BEARING ON THE LEGALITY WHEN INTERACTING WITH THEM IS NOT SEEN AS GAMBLING BECAUSE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES ARE DUE ON GAINS, WHEREAS THIS CGT IS NOT PAYABLE WITH GAMBLING INCOME (therefore it seems logical that these immutable blockchain-based games and tokens are unlikely to fall under gambling regulations if the tokens are to be treated as assets or there is no randomness involved but please check with your local laws before interacting)., ",

Currently, the Gauges system distributes rewards to Senior Perpetual Yield Tranches. Status: Live This program will last 2 years and is used to reward liquidity providers depending on the amount of funds deposited and the utility generated by the pool (APY of the pool); it will distribute 18% of the total supply (2'340'000 IDLE) on a per-block basis across all Idle Best Yield strategies. Part of the funds devoted to liquidity mining for the BY strategy has been moved to the Gauges system of the Perpetual Yield Tranches. Status: distribution voted by Idle DAO This program is meant to reward long-term actors and liquidity providers of the Idle ecosystem. 20% of the total supply (2'600'000 IDLE) is allocated to this program. The long-term distribution program won't start right at the governance launch, but 20% of the total supply has already been reserved and sent to the LongLPFund 0x107A369bc066c77FF061c7d2420618a6ce31B925 which is managed by the governance. Status: Ended This program distributed 3% of the total supply (390'000 IDLE) to liquidity during the first 30 days after governance inception. It has been based on the Liquidity Mining program with applied an x4 multiplier to the basic reward amount per block. The Liquidity Mining program distributes $IDLE through the IdleController contract, which computes the utility generated by each BY strategy (idleDAI, idleUSDC, ...) and proportionally allocates the $IDLE rewards between all these pools. To compute the utility generated by each strategy, the IdleController uses a PriceOracle which reads data such as WBTC or COMP price (in USD) and uses it to compute the correct share of LM program distribution for each pool. To update the distribution speeds, and effectively adjust the IDLE distribution for the strategies depending on current TVL and APYs, the public method refreshIdleSpeeds should be called from time to time. Funds for the Liquidity Mining and the Liquidity Bootstrap programs have been sent to the Reservoir contract which progressively unlocks IDLE rewards for the IdleController. In order to transfer unlocked IDLE from the Reservoir to the IdleController the Reserve contract should be poked by calling the drip method. Gauges rewards are distributed through the Distributorcontract. The governance is also responsible for managing the Ecosystem Fund 0xb0aA1f98523Ec15932dd5fAAC5d86e57115571C7 which represents 15% of the total supply (1'950'000 IDLE). This fund's purpose is to fund Idle DAO and its community. Additionally, 4% of the total supply (520'000 IDLE) has been reserved, at launch, to Early LPs through the Early Rewards contract 0xa1F71ED24ABA6c8Da8ca8C046bBc9804625d88Fc. Early Rewards not claimed 90 days after launch (26th November 2020) have been automatically transferred to the Ecosystem Fund. The remaining 40% of the supply is allocated in the following manner: Team + Future Team: 22.7% of the total supply (with a 3 years lockup: 33.33% unlocked after 1 year, 66.67% unlocked linearly for the next 24 months) Investors: 17.3 % of the total supply (with a 2 years lockup: 25% unlocked after 6 months, 75% unlocked linearly for the next 18 months) Both lockup schedules started on Nov 26th 2020, and are enforced through the following smart contracts: Team + Future Team 0x06a44ce4A37DbA5a90267db93c144522d5C178f6 0x9e5A7EeB2eB6BBb735c75075114090015040909F 0xF1bD4d3f7E0172B9DAFCff91dEcD9F077ed01887 0x2e56C44E571A8F926e2CD8CB247a7074559c64dc Investors 0x57d2A95BEa18Ad894c35CE2Ca89C5928F9b2F912 0x53967E3FfdAb0a0f2BcE097383C34eC0A3F0b0fE 0xAEcF9166E9A7EF0F1eD1d399336cb92754d24C4b 0x33ae303013a4D866683b35C0483AC6D613222005 0x43fDd8d3E17A4E40ef97FED432B488105E620316 0xd458632330Cc973F6dF36Ff576343E27060B4E77 0x49d85B42c9B74355f7a0De600fD336E46d739201 0x9201e5043d5f370B167CD4660941F0bE50C01736 0x9366b9D783901d7eF7c7042064c55b0bA851Bda6 0x317ABEF0674A3be3dc4442F189C89d89c14E70F8 0x2c22d3689C5c66B8FB44702c05e25649955b2DD3 0xEF5472af5F46538B9A929517D2E1442060A67f58 0xCc1b0617783E162511Eea716929d879d78945814 0x48856A3B565e985e6742102aD0e5b976D32386b5 0xce65b6C59CfB37FD95Fe881317e6F8Bfe7830DEB The above $IDLE emission schedule does not take account of the Ecosystem Fund and the LongTerm LPs Program funds.

To operate most effectively as a DEX token, $KNIGHT has no max supply. KnightSwap's DEX token $KNIGHT is not meant to be a quick moonshot followed by a damp to the earth core. Enormous fluctuations in price make the ability to generate consistent returns difficult. Instead, a slow gradual rise overtime as user adoption and TVL is increased is much more favorable. The $KNIGHT token can be minted or bought back and burned, facilitating control over the supply and the price while accounting for farm and pool emissions. Referencing back to our opening statement: KnightSwap is built for reliable & sustainable yields while providing the highest quality Decentralized Finance (DeFi) experience. Initial WIZARD Offering (IWO) Initial $KNIGHT supply- 4 million tokens Initial starting liquidity $KNIGHT supply: 1.5 million tokens Ecosystem incentives $KNIGHT supply: 500,000 tokens IWO $KNIGHT supply: 2 million tokens The IWO took place on November 2nd, 2021. The total raise of $500,000 BUSD at $0.25 per $KNIGHT was oversubscribed by 643.35%. The IWO took place on November 2, 2021 & consisted of 2 million $KNIGHT tokens for sale. The raise was $500,000 BUSD, making the initial price of KNIGHT $0.25. The total raise achieved was 643.35% General Details Ticker: $KNIGHT Contract Address: https://bscscan.com/token/0xd23811058eb6e7967d9a00dc3886e75610c4abba Chart: https://www.dextools.io/app/bsc/pair-explorer/0xd71710c21fba293eb12e0ca079fe37f50ad17d42 Chain: BNB Chain (BEP-20) Being a DEX token there is no tax associated with the token $KNIGHT TOKEN EMISSIONS EMISSIONS/BLOCK ($KNIGHT) EMISSIONS/DAY($KNIGHT) 7.5 216,000 $KNIGHT sent to the Dev address will be burned once deflationary measures are needed to control overall token amount. BNB Chain average block time is 3 seconds but can vary based on congestion. You can check the BNB Chain block times below. https://ycharts.com/indicators/binance_smart_chain_average_block_time $KNIGHT DISTRIBUTION This is a rough estimate, the actual % distribution of rewards will be found from the addition of all the multipliers down below. The multipliers will occasionally be rebalanced in order to best support the ecosystem, while the token emissions will not. SENT TO REWARD/BLOCK (% of emission) REWARD/BLOCK (total $KNIGHT) REWARD/DAY FARMS 75% 5.625 216,000 POOL (Knight for Knight Raid) 25% 1.875 72,000 MULTIPLIERS On each of the farms and pools, you will see a multiplier. In this example, 60X (shown at the top of the farm). This is just an indicator of what % of the token emissions will go toward a particular farm (the $KNIGHT pool will be counted as a single stake farm). To figure out how many $KNIGHT tokens get emitted to a particular farm the equation is: ($KNIGHT Per Block/Total Multiplier) x Farm Multiplier. Let's walk through an example. Current sum of multipliers: 45+60+15+1+5+2+2+2+2+1+1+.75+1+.5+1+30 = 169.25X Emissions per multiplier: 7.5/169.25 = 0.044313. For a 60X multiplier (KNIGHT BNB LP): 0.044313x60 = 2.65 $KNIGHT per block. How to Confirm $KNIGHT Supply for yourself To confirm that the circulating $KNIGHT supply shown on the KnightSwap homepage is correct, 1. Head to the $KNIGHT token contract on BscScan and see how much $KNIGHT is held by the Burn Address. That's the total amount of $KNIGHT that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve). 2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the 'Total Supply' that BscScan shows. 3. This gives you the actual $KNIGHT supply.

However, they also include a custom zero-fee market that allows for complicated deals and trades of up to 100 Meebits per transaction, as well as basic bid and ask transactions. This page provides details on how this custom marketplace works. Overview The integrated Meebits market is a zero-fee system that allows simple buy, bid and ask transactions as well as complicated 'like-kind' trades involving up to 100 meebits. You can create a new proposed trade by going to your Trading Terminal. When appearing in search results and listing pages, market details related to each Meebit are displayed in the following manner: On Chain, Off Chain, and Cancelling Deals The Meebits marketplace is run partially 'off chain' to reduce fees and network usage. What this means is that proposing a trade requires no network transaction fee (gas), you will simply be asked to sign a message. If someone decides to accept the deal they will submit that signed message to the blockchain and pay a transaction fee to complete the deal. However, cancelling a trade does require a network fee because you are telling the on chain portion of the trading system 'if you ever see this signed message, don't accept it.' However in all cases it's important to note that the market charges no fees itself, you only pay the Ethereum network fee (gas) when necessary. Email Notifications New Meebit owners can receive email notifications for any deals offered to them. To do this, unlock your Ethereum wallet, then click on your address in the header. You will be prompted to prove ownership of your address by signing a message. After this your owner settings will be available: Set and verify your email address to begin receiving emails when new deals are proposed to your acocunt. You can also choose to hide that you have notifications enabled, but we recommend you leave this status public as you will receive more offers. Meebit detail pages will indicate when notifications are enabled: And a notification icon will appear on Meebits in search results: You can also search for all Meebits with notifications enabled. Indicate Meebits You Would Like to Trade New Meebit owners can now indicate which Meebits they're interested in trading or receiving offers for. To do this, go to the detail page for any Meebit you own and prove ownership. Owner settings will then be enabled for this Meebit: The Meebit detail page will then indicate you are interested in receiving offers for this Meebit: And an 'interested in a trade' icon will appear on Meebits in search results: You can also search for all Meebits that are interested in being traded.

Words used for the random generation were sourced from cultural critic Angelicism01's essay on Milady, 'NO MILADY NFTS, NOT NOW' with Chief Keef's 'Finally Rich', and Chief Keef's 'Kush with them Beans,' as a playful and irreverent response to the environmental and capitalist criticisms made in Angelicism01's review, as a commentary on the inevitable cultural subsumption process of capitalism.

Staking is a process in which cryptocurrency holders lock their funds in a blockchain to support the operations of a network. In return for their participation, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency tokens. What is the reward for staking ? The amount you can earn from cryptocurrency staking depends on several factors, including the chosen cryptocurrency, the staking rewards, and the price appreciation of the staked tokens. Different cryptocurrencies have different staking rewards and rates. Some may offer higher rewards, while others may offer lower rewards. Generally, the higher the staking rewards, the more you can potentially earn. It's important to note that staking involves locking up your cryptocurrency for a certain period of time, and the rewards are typically given out periodically. The actual earnings will depend on the amount of cryptocurrency staked and the duration of the staking period. What tokens can I allocate? Move Stake is a large and reputable cryptocurrency platform that offers its customers the best in platforming services. With its own native token, Move Stake Token (MVB) . By investing with Move Stake, customers receive free MVB tokens equal to their investment as a gift. MVB has a bright future and is set to be traded on major exchanges around the world.

Volatility Risk: Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile, and staked assets are subject to price fluctuations. 2. Smart Contract Risks: Staking usually involves locking up funds in smart contracts, which are prone to coding errors and vulnerabilities. 3. Slashing Risk: Certain staking mechanisms have a slashing penalty for misbehavior or rule violations by validators. 4. Liquidity Risk: Staking usually requires locking up funds for a certain period, during which the staked assets may not be easily accessible or tradable. Move Stake's services are fully decentralized, so these risks are minimal. Reliable infrastructure provides additional security and high quality of services. Where does Move Stake place its working validators ? We work with various cloud providers such as Cloud, AWS, GCP, Azure, OVH or Scaleway. How does Move Stake ensure security ?

Cryptonium (Cp): No total supply limit. You can mainly acquire Cp by burning GUM and through activities in Cryptid Wars. Crypto Ingot (CI): It is an off-chain resource obtained by consuming Cp in the Cryptid Wars. CI can be converted to MCHC. When giving CI to the community, a certain percentage will be given to the marketing, development and operation pools as described in the link below. MCH Coin (MCHC): An on-chain ERC20 token which can be claimed in a 1:1 ratio to CI. How to get Crypt Ingots (CI) To trade and get more information CoinGecko UNISWAP QUICKSWAP How to get MCHC You can exchange your CI for MCHC by clicking on 'claim' in the MCHC Rewards page. You need to pay the gas fee to claim your MCHC. You can exchange CI for MCHC at a 1:1 ratio at any time. At the time of exchange, all of the CI you are holding will be exchanged. [2022.02.18] A convert function has been added so that CI can be claimed on Polygon. When converting, all your CI is converted to off-chain MCHC so you can claim your tokens on Polygon. There is no way to convert it back. How to get Cp 1. Burning GUM You can get 10 Cp by burning 1 GUM. For example, when you buy a Hero for 1,000 GUM on MCHs Trade Market, 5% of the total trade cost is charged as a fee, and 50% of the total cost will be distributed to your Land as the Land Reward. So, burned GUM is [1,000 GUM*5%*50% = 25 GUM], which means that you can get 250 Cp. *Cp is no longer awarded for the official Hero Sale as of May 2022. Also, when a user who signed up using your referral code gets Cp by burning GUM, you can also get Cp as a referral reward equal to 10% of the Cp received by the user. In the example above, 2,000 Cp will be granted to you. For more information on burning GUM rates, please see the help section below. >Land Reward 2. Game Play Hero Mining This is a game mode where you can get Cp by locking a Hero in a Quest for 7 days. See Mining for details. Colosseum You can earn Cp as a reward for the Colosseum. Please check the Colosseum for details. Cryptid Wars Cp will be given according to the results of each seasons Cryptid Wars. For more information, please check the reward for the Cryptid Wars. *There are plans to add other ways of obtaining Cp in future updates. Back to the list Docs Docs, ",

Registreer en koop Bitcoin - - Bitcoin snel kopen zonder wallet met iDEAL Bitcoin kopen is op dit moment bijzonder populair. Het cryptogeld, bedacht door Satoshi Nakamoto, heeft een zeer stabiel peer to peer netwerk. Door het gedecentraliseerde karakter van de blockhain is dit netwerk een gewilde digitale valuta om in te handelen. Niet alleen vanwege het rustige verloop, voor virtuele valuta begrippen, van de BTC koers, maar ook de immense handelsvolume maken Bitcoin een interessant object. Daarnaast zijn de coins vooral leuk omdat ze echt gebruikt wordt als betaalmiddel. Als je online eten besteld kan je in veel gevallen de betaling doen in BTC, er komt dan geen bankrekening meer bij aan te pas. Triaconta biedt investeerders aan om Bitcoins aan te schaffen met verschillende, eenvoudige betaalmethoden, waaronder iDeal, overboeking en Bancontact. Je hoeft niet meer naar de grote cryptovaluta beurzen toe om via een technische analyse te bekijken of dit een goed moment is voor het aankopen of verkopen van BTC. Minimaal 100 Het minimale bedrag is 100 Close Maximaal 10.000 Het maximale bedrag is 10.000 per betaling. Neem contact op met info@triaconta.com als je voor meer wilt kopen. Close Selecteer je bank Selecteer welke bank je wilt gebruiken voor de betaling. Close Kosten en voorwaarden accepteren Voordat we jouw verzoek kunnen verwerken moet je de kosten en voorwaarden accepteren. Close Email Vul een correct email adres in Close Koop kosten De kosten voor aanschaf van cryptocurrencies of van een bundel zijn 2% over het bedrag dat betaald wordt. Close Hoe werkt het? 1. Registreer je gratis Registreer je gratis op ons platform, kijk rustig rond naar de mogelijkheden en verifieer je identiteit. 2. Kies de bundel of crypto die je wil Kies in het platform welke bundel of losse cryptocurrency je wilt kopen en bepaal je gewenste investering. 3. Reken direct af Reken direct af met iDEAL, Bancontact of overboeking. Je crypto wordt meteen aan je account toegevoegd en kan je op elk moment verkopen. 4. Veilig & ontzorgd Je crypto wordt veilig door ons opgeslagen. Met behulp van onze management tools word je volledig ontzorgd en je bundel altijd up to date gehouden. Bitcoin kopen snel en gemakkelijk Wij bieden de mogelijkheid om alle soorten cryptocurrency snel en simpel te kopen. Wij slaan deze cryptomunten veilig voor je op, zodat je hier geen omkijken naar hebt. Investeren in Bitcoin (BTC) wordt zo een kwestie van een klik op de knop. Vervolgens kun je in je persoonlijke gebruikersportaal gemakkelijk zien hoe de munten het doen. In je gebruikersportaal kan je op elk moment besluiten om meer BTC aan te schaffen of juist te verkopen op het moment dat jij dat wilt. En dit gebruikersportaal kan je nog extra veilig maken door middel van “two factor authentication” (2FA) met Google Authenticator. Met deze vorm van 2FA heb je je telefoon nodig om in te kunnen loggen in je portaal. Dit is een extra beveiliging tegen phishing of als hackers je mailbox binnendringen. Als laatste veiligheids maatregel gebruikt Triaconta het ‘euro in -> euro uit principe. Dit betekent dat klanten hun aankoop alleen door middel van een eurobetaling kunnen doen vanaf een Europese IBAN rekening. Als een klant zijn cryptocoins verkoopt en een uitbetaling aanvraagt, zal de uitbetaling altijd plaatsvinden naar het IBAN nummer dat gebruikt is om de crypto te kopen. Op die manier kunnen kwaadwilligen nooit geld buit maken.

Answer Link answered 2019-07-09 Triaconta 3) Q: Wat is de toekomst verwachting van de Bitcoin koers? 1 3) Q: Wat is de toekomst verwachting van de Bitcoin koers? asked 2019-07-09 Don Molenaar 1 answers 1 votes 1 A: In mei 2020 was de derde 'Halving' van Bitcoin, dit houdt in dat de beloning voor Bitcoin miners voor de derde keer gehalveerd werd. Na de voorgaande halvings maakte Bitcoin steeds een 'Bullrun' waar een nieuwe all time high werd gevestigd. Diverse Bitcoin investeerders hebben nu de hoop dat dit weer gaat gebeuren en het vorige record van $ 20.000 wordt verpulverd. Of dit ook echt gaat gebeuren blijft natuurlijk afwachten.

A self-sustaining, secure and transparent smart pyramid game. Buy In Smart Contract The Most Powerful & Decentralized Pyramid Yet Profit When someone purchases or sells a POFL token, 25% of the buy/sell price is split by the total number of tokens and given as locked-in dividends (priced in Ether) to all previous buyers based on how many POFL tokens they own. Dividends 25% of every buy and sell will be rewarded to token holders. Strong hands will be rewarded through every crash and pump. The smart contract, unlike other schemes, will allow you to directly convert your dividends back into tokens, increasing your ability to earn more dividends. Forever Seriously, no self destruct, no exit scam. This contract will fluctuate in price and pay out dividends until the Ethereum network dies. At any time, you can sell your tokens back to the smart contract for the current price, or withdraw/convert the dividends you've accumulated! Frequently Asked Questions Q: Is POFL secure? A: Yes. Our developer team put a lot of time into refining and testing this contract to make sure your tokens are safe. Internal functions of the contract are not accessible to the end user. Q: What do I need to buy into this smart contract game? A: You need to install MetaMask and also need to buy some Ether (ETH), probably from something like Coinbase. Q: Are you planning to steal our Ether? A: We're hurt that you had to ask. No, there is no way for any participant to withdraw the Ether of any other participant. Q: So exactly what happens with the tokens that I buy? A: Every time somebody buys or sell an POFL token, the price changes - 0.2% higher upon buy, 0.2% lower upon sell. If you keep your tokens where they are, you receive 25% from every buy OR sell transaction based upon your current share of tokens. You can convert your current token stash into Ether where it will sit in your dividends pool - your dividends are stored in ETH, not in tokens, so their value remains stable (as long as the ETH price itself remains stable.) However once you've converted your tokens, you won't be gaining any dividends - and if you want back in you'll need to either purchase more or simply convert your dividends pool straight back into tokens. Q: Hmm, sounds interesting. Can you tell me more? A: Our system mitigates the risk of fast dumping by penalizing sellers for doing so. If there is a sell off period, you will still be collecting dividends, as well as gain a larger portion of the total token market share in the process. If a buy/sell cycle occurs, the token holders will still collect dividends off the sales, in addition to gaining a larger portion of the total token market share in the process. This way, those who attempt to time the market and perform swing trades; selling high and re-buying low, will be risking a lot - and losing out on soaking up all those precious dividends. If you'd prefer to sit back and play it safe you will profit off of the madness of the greedy whales and weak-handed alike., ",

At any time, you can sell your tokens back to the smart contract for the current price, or withdraw/convert the dividends you've accumulated! Frequently Asked Questions Q: Is this a real thing? A: Yes, POHotBody Tokens are built on the Ethereum blockchain. They have no value outside of engaging in the SB game with our Math Robot though and you SHOULD NOT consider them a real investment or asset class with any intrinsic value OF ANY FORM. Q: Wasn't there something similar to this earlier? A: Yes, there are several variations of ponzis, pyramids, and other schemes; POHotBody is the next step forward with convertible dividends and 10% redistribution on sell. Q: Is POHotBody secure? A: Yes. Our developer team put a lot of time into refining and testing this contract to make sure your tokens are safe. Internal functions of the contract are not accessible to the end user. Q: What do I need to buy into this Pyramid? A: You need to install MetaMask and also need to buy some Ether (ETH), probably from something like Coinbase. Q: Are you planning to steal our Ether? A: We're hurt that you had to ask. No, there is no way for any participant to withdraw the Ether of any other participant. Q: So exactly what happens with the tokens that I buy?

If you'd prefer to sit back and play it safe you will profit off of the madness of the greedy whales and weak-handed alike. Q: So I should definitely get into credit card debt to play this game? A: NO. You most certainly should not be putting anything you can't afford to lose on this. PLEASE do not consider this to be anything other than what it intends to be: an insane proof of concept turned global prisoners dilemma. It is a joke, and should be treated as such. Do not put anything in here that you are not immediately willing to treat as lost. Q: So what is that you guarantee exactly? A: Nothing. Seriously. Pyramid schemes are, by definition, a zero sum game. The risk is entirely yours. Tread carefully. Good luck and have fun! And remember, it's internet monopoly money. Don't do anything you'll lose sleep (or your family) over. Home My Coins Smart Contract Social Discord Disclaimer This game is intended for entertainment purposes only. Do not send any ETH you do not want to or cannot afford to lose. There is zero guarantee that you will make ETH playing this game. And more importantly, zero guarantee that you won't lose any ETH you play with. Play at your own risk and do not attempt to pressure friends, family or strangers into playing too.

The name “PYRA” is derived from the concept of a capstone or pyramidion, which represents the highest block or peak of a structure. The barter credit methodology and the number of blocks in its construction are the driving force behind PYRAs multi-chain token, which has a 0.01% SCIF (Smart Contract Interaction Fee in PYRA). PYRA utilizes the underlying blockchain of the users choice for gas and has a total supply that is not pegged to any single blockchain, currency, technology, asset, real estate, resource, or state. PYRA is a utility token that captures equity/value from the exchange of goods or services, where fiat or cash is typically not involved (supported use case). It is a digital means of barter that leverages blockchain/distributed ledger technology and a process to collateralize tokens by individuals. This approach represents a true DeFi implementation, bridging modern systems with our oldest means of transacting. PYRAs Barter Credit is derived and reaches a consensus from a plurality of the cryptocurrency/digital asset market. The concept originated in October 2017 and became viable due to the explosion of digital asset creation. Like a pyramid, it takes many years and a lot of builders to complete the 14th step and place the pyramidion. PYRA at scale represents “Equityism.” PYRA is a NETA token (Non-Exchange Traded Asset). The smart contract does not have an API to report PYRAs numbers, and peers may choose their wallets. While a peer can attempt to list PYRA on a decentralized exchange (DEX), which is peer-to-peer, there is no pricing information reported for PYRA through API or value to swap with other tokens. Users can utilize the PYRA App to calculate the number of tokens to transfer and their Barter Power (USD). Read More January 14, 2013 No Comments PYRAbarter.com brokered barter exchange.

By tying the tokens value to a living wage rate for a region, as determined by reputable sources like MIT, users would be incentivized to hold onto the token rather than trading it for other assets or currencies. The time bank use of the PYRA token could operate on a peer-to-peer basis, with individuals and businesses exchanging services and skills directly with one another using the token as a medium of exchange. The value of each transaction would be based on the time and expertise required to complete the task, with a living wage rate serving as a baseline for the value of each hour of work. In this way, the token could serve as a form of collateral for the services being exchanged. Users could accumulate and store their time credits in the form of PYRA tokens, which could then be exchanged for goods or services of equivalent value within the time bank network. The use of a time bank also has the potential to create new opportunities for economic growth and development, particularly for individuals and small businesses that may not have access to traditional forms of credit or financing. By participating in the time bank network, users could build up a reputation and a track record of successful transactions, which could in turn lead to new business opportunities and partnerships. Overall, collateralizing the PYRA token through a time bank use could create a new and innovative approach to value creation and exchange. By tying the value of the token to a living wage rate and using it as a medium of exchange for peer-to-peer services, the token could help to create a more equitable and sustainable economy.

Layer Zero Labs omnichain fungible token (OFT) interoperability solution enables native, cross-chain token transfers. As voted in by Governance Proposal RFP-4, $RDNT emissions incentivize ecosystem participants to provide utility to the platform as dynamic liquidity providers (dLP). Only users with locked dLP (liquidity tokens) activate eligibility for RDNT emissions on their deposits or borrows. Additionally, dLPs share in the utility of Platform Fees is captured in blue-chip assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and stablecoins from borrowers paying loan interest, flash loans, and liquidation fees. Through decentralized discussions, voting, and governance, the Radiant DAO has and always will dictate the decisions, and, ultimately, the vision of the Radiant ecosystem. It is encouraged for all users to watch the Explainer Video located on the Markets page. Liquidity Mining Only users with locked Dynamic Liquidity (Liquidity Tokens) activate eligibility to receive RDNT emissions within the money market. $RDNT Liquidity mining emissions can be instantly claimed for the total amount on the condition that they are zapped into locked dLP tokens by pairing the claimed $RDNT with wstETH/BNB. Alternatively, emissions may be vested for three months. Vesting RDNT may be claimed early for an exit penalty to receive 10-75% of rewards, decaying linearly during the three-month vesting period. This penalty fee is then distributed 90% to the Radiant DAO reserve, and the remaining 10% is sent to the Radiant Starfleet Treasury. Locking dLP tokens is a one to twelve-month process and must be re-locked after maturity to continue receiving platform fees. For a detailed breakdown of how dynamic liquidity provisioning functions, visit the dLP section of the Gitbook.

Sell Acorns ? ETH for (NOTE: this is the default value. Adjust this number up or down to sell different amounts of acorns.) INTRO SnailFarm 2 is a competitive idle game on the Ethereum blockchain. Buy snails with ether, then hatch their eggs to get more snails until you can reach the coveted position of Snailmaster. Eggs can also be bought or sold for ether, directly to the contract. Several boosters are available to hatch more snails at once. For a more passive playstyle, buy acorns from the ethertree and redeem them for ether later. REWARDS All ether spent on the game is split between the snailpot and the treepot. The snailpot can be claimed by whoever reaches the Snailmaster title. This snailpot also governs egg price on the market. The treepot is an extra fund any acorn holder can claim their share of, by selling their acorns. EGGS Eggs can be bought and sold directly to the contract. Their price varies on the number of eggs available on the market, as well as the current snailpot. It costs twice as much ether to buy eggs as to sell them. ACORNS The price of an acorn is equal to the treepot divided by the total number of acorns. This price can only grow over time. Acorns are initially purchased at a loss. When the snailpot is below the previous snailpot (like at the beginning of a new round), 3 acorns can be bought for the price of 4. When the snailpot is above the previous snailpot, 1 acorn can be bought for the price of 2. SNAILMASTER Once you reach a certain amount of snails, you can claim the Snailmaster title. Doing so entitles you to 20% of the current snailpot. However, most of your snails perish in the process (90%). When someone becomes the Snailmaster, a new round starts. The requirement to be Snailmaster starts at 100,000, and rises by 100,000 times the previous round number with every new round. The number of starting snails new players get increase proportionally. BOOSTERS The SpiderQueen, the SquirrelDuke and the TadpolePrince can be obtained to boost your hatch size. Each of them adds an extra batch of snails to your hatch (for example, if you hatch 100 eggs and own the Duke and the Prince, you get 100+100+100 = 300 snails). Boosters are unique 'hot potato' items. Once you buy them, someone else can buy them from you for a higher price. The SpiderQueen requires a sacrifice of 80 snails initially, and doubles with each new flip. The SquirrelDuke requires a sacrifice of 1 acorn initially, and also doubles with each new flip. The TadpolePrince costs 0.02 eth initially, and this cost rises by 20% with each new flip. The previous Tadpole holder gets 110% of his ETH back when the Tadpole is flipped. Previous Spider and Squirrel owners do not get anything back on a flip. Booster requirements are reset to their minimum with every new round (Snailmaster). METAMASK This game requires Metamask, ",

		"input": "Prisoner's Dilemma on the Blockchain '4% daily, forever... ...until others ruin it' SnailTree is a smart contract game on Ethereum. It mimicks High-Yield Investment Programs (HYIP). HYIP schemes are Ponzi scams. They promise impossibly high returns by paying previous investors with the money of newcomers. In other words, SnailTree is a tale of madness and hubris. 'You can't lose... ...more than your initial' Sounds great, but how do we make it a game? In traditional HYIP, there's only one strategy: get in early. After that, pray enough people will throw their money in the burning pile. SnailTree gives you more than just ether. Not only you get ETH, you also get tokens. On top of that, there's a big, juicy jackpot. >>> You convinced me! Let me in, NOW! <<< 'I am now a millionaire... ...in digital nuts' SnailTree rewards your investment with digital Pecans. Trade these Pecans to the smart contract for instant ETH. That's not all! Trading Pecans fills up a bar. Fill up that bar, and you win the ETH jackpot. 'There's nothing to fear... ...save for financial ruin' Your ETH and Pecan rewards are available from the first minute. Claim them as soon as you want, as often as you want. But there's a catch. The longer you wait, the more Pecans you get. By waiting long enough, you will get more rewards. By waiting too long, other players will claim the jackpot. >>> I'm ready to lose all my money! <<< 'Freedom to leave... ...all caution behind' You're free to get out any time you want. Your exit is safeguarded by the smart contract. However... By reinvesting your rewards every hour, you get a special Boost. This Boost is a direct multiplier to your Pecans. Your Pecans can be traded for Ether or help you win the jackpot. 'Everyone's a winner... ...but not in here' The longer the game goes without fresh investment, the more Pecans given to the next person. Getting in early could reward you well. Getting in later could reward you better. Getting in at the right time could get you the win. Who knows? Certainly not us. Stop thinking and come gamble your ether away. >>> My kids don't need college anyway! <<< THE SNAILTREE: BACKSTORY ~~a poem by Sir Slugalot~~ there once was a Squirrel from the Forest, who, simply put, wasn't the smartest. one day, he saw Snails building a Throne, thought 'easy stuff, I'm as good as anyone!' his mind set, the Squirrel's folly began, instead of Shell, he would use Pecan come along, Ether wanderers, trade your Harvest to the mad Wonkers. TESTIMONIALS FROM CRYPTO EXPERTS Vitalik Buterin 'Not giving away ETH.' Roger Ver 'When starting a business, not having any money forces you to be more creative.' Nick Szabo 'I encourage holding crypto the way it's meant to be held, i.e. directly.' Justin Sun 'The detail will be released this week.' >>> Where do I sign? <<< SNAILTREE IS NOT JUST ONE VERY BAD IDEA It's one in a whole ecosystem of very bad ideas.

A community is formed when everyone bonds the underlying assets into a common reserve currency, creating a strong “bonding” for the whole community. As Spartacus we carry on the legacy and we shall aim higher and something even bigger. We lay out a few phases for Spartacus future: Phase I - the rise of the glorious gladiator A Spartacus wont be a Spartacus without the support of the Spartacus community. Rather than giving the early access to investors or a selected elite groups, we want everyone in the Spartacus community to have a fair chance of participation. Introducing Liquidity Bootstrap Event (LBE) for $SPA, the governance token for Spartacus DAO. Our LBE will be open for all. Similar to Olympus IDO, the Spartacus LBE will be the main source to provide initial liquidity and treasurys initial backing for SPA. 30,000 SPA token will be minted for the event. Initial price of SPA token will be 10 Dai/SPA for 500 unique addresses, with each address limited to 60 SPA only. The LBE event will last for 24 hours. This will result in $300K Dai in total sales from the LBE. The first $200K Dai will be used to bootstrap the liquidity and provide initial treasury backing for the SPA token. $140K Dai will be paired with 7K SPA token on Spooky swap, establishing the initial extrinsic price of $20 Dai per SPA with initial liquidity of $280,000. $60,000 Dai will be deposited to the treasury, backing the initial SPA supply. This will be done within 24 hours after the LBE event. We will announce the exact time when the initial liquidity will be added, providing total transparency to our community. What about the LP token? The $280K worth of LP token will be deposited to the treasury via a prolonged and controlled bonding process, with 1/100 a time across 100 epochs. The rest $100K Dai will be used to support the Spartacus dev work. We believe this is essential for maintaining the health of the Spartacus protocols. Only the fund exceeding the initial $200K will be used for development. That means, if the total raised fund from LBE is only $250K, $200K will be used to initial liquidity and treasury backing, and $50K will be used to support dev work. Why we believe this is important? We are trying to be 100% transparent with the Spartacus community. Both Olympus and Klima raised private rounds via pToken which works like an option but also dilutes the total share in the future. We are proposing a fixed rate round only to ensure the Spartacus DAO can be sustained. Future development work can be funded via the Spartacus DAO through a DAO voting procedure. We plan to launch the bonding function within 48 hours after the LDE event. We will target 10% discount positive ROI for bonders across the board for both SPA-DAI LP pool and the Dai pool. A total of 37k SPA tokens will be minted during the LBE event (30k for presale and 7k requied to pair with Dai to initialize liquidity). If SPA tokens are not sold out during the LBE, any remaining SPA tokens will be sent back to the Spartacus DAO. Exact launch time of LBE will be announced in our Discord. Phase II - sustainable growth and expansion of Spartacus DAO With a successful Phase 1 launch of Spatacus protocol, we have even more ambitious plans for our fellow Spartacus. We would love to share with our community what are on the horizon and we would also want to hear your thoughts as well. 1. Diversifying the basket of treasury with support on FTM, WETH, and other strategic assets. 2. Treasury vault strategies to earn risk-adjusted return with DAO governance. 3. Starting Spartacadabra, our own version of Magic Internet Money and Spell ecosystem. This can be another domain for the Spartacus army to conquer. With a strong community we believe that only sky is our limit. We look forward to hearing back each and all of you on your feedback and suggestions. Are you ready to make Rome tremble?

The primary goal of a fair launch, as its name suggest, is to distribute almost all of the tokens to users on our platform. This is in contrast to the frequently used model for token distribution such as Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), Token Generating Events (TGE) or Initial Decentralized Offerings (IDO) that allocates a considerable chunk of their tokens to initial investors and institutional investors. Stella wants everyone to have access to our tokens in a fair and transparent manner. StellaSwap's native token - STELLA - will be a governance token that is embedded with various value-accrual mechanisms and utility to maximize tokenholder value. The token distribution follows a fixed supply, linear emission model that is coupled with burning or deflationary mechanisms to reduce overall supply.

WHITEPAPER AUDIT Report $ 0.012 USDC = 1 SMTXContract Address: 0x102203517ce35AC5Cab9a2cda80DF03f26c7419b SMTX solves the very fundemental issue of institutional finance:- illiquid nature of assets (Real Estates, unlisted company shares, bonds, fixed deposits). Often locked in from months to years, SMTXs AssetFi tokenization protocol provides the solution to this. Imagine, a tokenized Real Estate will become borderless as there will be no geographical limitation to owning a piece of real estate. Furthermore, the barrier of entry to owning a piece of huge real estate/business is reduced as tokens are divisible. Fund managers and financial institutions who wish to liquidate/tokenise their funds or asset can do it on SMTXs protocol. Institutional finance is poised for disruption, and SMTX is spearheading web3 to it. Claim your purchased token here Connect now THE STORY ABOUT US Founded in 2021, Sumotex was established to revolutionize the long stagnated real estate industry. Traditional (Web2) Real Estates are known to be illiquid, expensive, and vague where we think that it is time for web3 Real Estate to take over. Institutional finance has always been the foundation of our economic growth, a paradigm shift towards blockchain is unavoidable. SUMOTEX always believe that the stagnated institutional finance and real estate sector is poised to be disrupted with our Web3 solution, the AssetFi protocol. Our protocol is based on the tokenization of off-chain assets ( Real estates, bonds, funds, company shares). Decentralization of Asset Manager (Role) With our AssetFi protocol, any asset owner, family offices and financial institutions can gain access to the technology and resources SMTX provide on a deal by deal or portfolio basis. Investment and lending vault (Asset) Onboarded asset manager will be able to issue/start their funds with their offering after the asset is approved by the governance protocol. Real Estate backed STABLECOIN SMTX will issue its first ever real estate backed stable coin, assets verified by a public trustee which acts as a node validator. It will be the world most safe stable coin as it is pegged against real estate, one of the most capital secured assets.

UNIC will be a governance token capped at 1M total supply, and the inflation rate will decrease approximately once a month. Unicly will be governed by UNIC token holders. You can farm UNIC by staking whitelisted LP tokens and/or staking UNIC to earn more UNIC. Who built Unicly? Me! Im Leia, nice to meet you. I go by 0xLeia on most platforms. I build, design, and draw stuff :) How will UNIC be launched? Who are the investors? There are no investors. It will be a completely fair launch. Ill start with 1 UNIC and whitelist some pools. At that point, anybody can provide liquidity and stake LP tokens to earn UNIC. UNIC will be minted to LP token stakers each block. Youll be able to claim and stake your UNIC to earn even more UNIC. The first month will have the highest UNIC mint rate ever, so the earlier you participate, the better. What can you do on Unicly? You can find uToken collections on the Discover.

If you believe that the total value of the bids on the collection is high enough for the collection, you should stake your uTokens to unlock the NFTs. Once enough people stake, you can redeem your uTokens for some of the NFT auction proceeds. How do you farm UNIC? If you have uTokens, its always good to provide liquidity, since you can stake your LP tokens to earn more UNIC. You can do this on the Farm page.

We are here today because there have been many community members and liquidity providers who have supported us during the journey over the past few months. With the growth and development of XY Finance, DAO governance is the next step in our community and LP outreach. In order to advance towards this goal, XY Token will be launched. XY Token is XY Finance's native utility token and governance token and has the following current and planned functions: Staking incentives: XY Token holders will be able to stake their tokens on the protocol and act as a catalyst to boost rewards on provided liquidity by up to 2.5 times. XY Token holders who stake their tokens will receive a portion of the revenue generated by the protocol. Liquidity mining: Liquidity providers can stake their assets into the Y Pool to receive xyTokens, such as xyUSDT. In addition to earning swap fees, to further incentivize these providers given opportunity costs, liquidity providers will be eligible to receive XY Tokens through a liquidity mining program, adjusted based on a user's relative contribution and additional parameters. Governance: XY token holders will be able to participate and vote in the governance process of the platform. Through governance, users can influence and modify product features and key parameters of XY Finance. This will enable XY Token holders to influence the direction of the protocol's development. XY Token will be supplied on every single chain supported by XY protocol. If joining liquidity mining program on BSC, you receive XY Token as rewards on BSC. Similarly, providing liquidity on Ethereum brings you XY Token on Ethereum. XY Finance provides an official bridge for XY Token to cross among supported chains. With the support of consensus, users are able to deposit assets and collect rewards on multiple chains easily and safely. Allocation The total supply will be 100,000,000 XY Tokens to be minted with no possibility for future inflation. The tokens will be distributed in the Token Generation Event (TGE), also known as our initial DEX offering (IDO) on Copper Launch, to the following stakeholders within the DAO. Lot Allocation Vesting Period Seed Round 7.5% vesting over 3 years with 10 months cliff Private Round 10% vesting over 2 years with 6 months cliff Strategy Round 6.5% vesting over 1.5 years with 4 months cliff Public Sale (IDO) 4% TGE Liquidity Fund for Mining & GameFi Reward 37% asymptotic vesting over 3 years Marketing and Bounties 15% vesting over 3 years Teams & Advisor 15% vesting over 3 years with 10 months cliff Insurance 5% fully locked in a multi-sign wallet and set as an emergency insurance fund that cannot be unlocked without XY DAOs approval Circulating Supply Token Economics XY Token Economy veXY The XY Finance is governed and upgraded by veXY Token holders. The contract of veXY Token allows the community to propose, vote, and implement changes through the administrative functions of strategies. Proposals can modify system parameters, initiate new Y pool, or add entirely new functionality to the protocol. You can lock your XY Tokens into veXY contract to get veXY Tokens. And there are five of periods to lock-in, from 1 week to 104 weeks. As longer period lock, the incentive will much higher than the shorter one. Vote As protocol grows, there will be more strategies to be integrated, more proposals to be raised from the community. As veXY holder, you will have voting rights for future protocol changes, including but not limited to change entry / exit fee factor, DAO reserves usage, protocol structure changes. Treasury As 20% of the swap fee goes into the treasury, the funds in the treasury will be used for two main purposes. 50% of the funds will be used for buying back XY tokens, and the remaining 50% will be used for XY DAO operations, including improving security, rewarding long-term contributors, paying for operational costs, and other related expenses across the entire XY ecosystem. Therefore, the treasury funds will become an important resource for XY DAO to actively invest in development, not only increasing the value of XY tokens but also maintaining the operation and security of the ecosystem for its prosperous growth.

Yeti Finance & YETI/YUSD are not avaliable in the U.S. Yeti Finance utilizes a two token system - $YETI and $YUSD. What is $YUSD? $YUSD is an over-collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin issued by Yeti Finance. It has multiple mechanisms to keep its price stable and pegged at $1. YUSD can be minted by depositing collateral on Yeti Finance. Learn more about price stability here: Mechanisms for YUSD Price Stability What is $YETI? $YETI is the Yeti Finance protocol token. In the future, $YETI will transition into a governance token. You can stake YETI to earn more YETI and veYETI. veYETI can be currently used for: (1) Boosting $YETI rewards for providing YUSD liquidity on Curve The veYETI model is designed to incentivize users to accumulate and stake $YETI through providing real utility to farmers and protocol users. When you unstake YETI, you lose your veYETI balance, similar to vePTP and veJOE. Users can begin accumulating veYETI at launch. Users staking at launch can get a head start on accumulating veYETI for its extensive utility implementations. What is YETI's distribution? 50% Community Incentives: Liquidity mining incentives, long-term liquidity providers, genesis liquidity providers, and grant programs. 25% Current and Future Team: This allocation linearly vest over a three year schedule with a 3-month lock. This allocation will be split amongst a core team of eight, non-core contributors, and future team members. 15% Foundation: Development cost, economic security, smart contract auditing, service providers (legal), operational expenses, and partnerships. 1.17% Strategic Partners: Avalanche Foundation, Genesis Block Ventures, Trader Joe, and the founders of BENQI (Hansen, JD, Dan) are the partners who have financially and non-financially supported Yeti Finance since the beginning. Strategic partners will have the same vesting schedule as the team and will continue to advise on future growth of the protocol. 8.83% Future Strategic Partners: This allocation is set aside in the case it would be definitively beneficial to everyone to bring in additional strategic partners. All future partners will be on a vesting schedule. If not used, this 9% will be divided amongst the Foundation and Community Incentives pool. What is YETI's emission/vesting schedule? YETI has a max supply of 500,000,000 tokens. Our community emissions schedule will look something similar to the schedule below. The schedule is front-loaded to bootstrap the protocol, with a higher emissions rate initially, and then a constant emissions rate for the next four years after that of 5,000,000 YETI emitted per month. Token emissions will begin in April 2022. Emission rates remain subject to change depending on market conditions. Projected Community Token Distribution Schedule We will be allocating roughly 70% of all Yeti emissions to Curve liquidity for the 6 months of the protocol, 20% to the stability pool, and 10% to Trader Joe pools—and then re-evaluate from there. Below is our rough targeted emissions schedule, though it is subject to change. The idea is that the first 3 months of the protocol will be a bootstrapping period with elevated emissions, and from then on we will be sticking with a slower, sustainable emissions rate.
