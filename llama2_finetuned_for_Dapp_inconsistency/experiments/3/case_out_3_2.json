        "output": "Okey, I have analyzed the text you provided, and I did not find any explicit mention of the liquidity lock time. However, I can infer some information based on the text.\n\nFirstly, the text mentions that the team relinquishes ownership of the contract in Phase 02, which suggests that the liquidity lock time might be longer than the duration of the project's development phase.\n\nSecondly, the text mentions that the project has a sell tax of 9%, which could indicate that the liquidity is locked for a longer period to ensure the sustainability of the project.\n\nBased on these inferences, I can say that the liquidity lock time for BabyBNBTiger might be around 5 years, but there is no explicit mention of the exact time in the text. Therefore, my output is:\n\nlock: 5 years (inferred)",
