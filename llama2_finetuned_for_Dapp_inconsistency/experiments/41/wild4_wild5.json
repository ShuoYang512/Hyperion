(Crocodylus porosus) Crocodilians are either hole nesters or mound nesters. That is, they either excavate a hole, usually in sand, and bury their eggs, or they construct a mound, usually out of vegetation, and deposit their eggs in the centre of it. Crocodile size, morphology, behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among species. However, they have many similarities in these areas as well. How this works? Sacrifice $CRO to adopt Crocodiles, they will use this nest to lay eggs and bury them in. You will have 2 choices with your new found eggs, you can either sell them to retrieve $CRO, or hatch them to grow your crocodile tribe! Join our community of Crocodiles owners on Telegram!

What is DIB Yield? DIB Yield is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for yield farming, staking, and liquidity provision using cryptocurrency. The platform operates on the blockchain and uses smart contracts for automated market maker (AMM) trades. Why users choose DIB Yield platform? DIB Yield offers high Annual Percentage Yield (APY) interest rates with no withdrawal or reward fees, making it an attractive option for yield farming. The platform's token, $DIB, has a unique tokenomics structure and is distributed to yield rewards, the DIB games fund, and development. How users earn in DIB Yield? Users can deposit into any pools by adding liquidity to the yield farming pair and selecting the pool they wish to join. Users immediately start receiving high rewards in $DIBs, with rewards rate varying in each pool. DIB Yield charges a deposit fee, and users can minimize this fee by joining the community campaigns or staking for longer periods. What is $DIB and how is it distributed? $DIB is a cryptocurrency token with a 10 $DIB/second emission rate and no cap on total supply. 90% of the tokens are allocated to yield farming rewards, 5% to the DIB games honeypot fund, and 5% to development as part of its tokenomics. Where can I get $DIB? You can earn $DIBs by staking liquidity into DIB Yield liquidity pools or by purchasing tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges. $DIB token listing is scheduled for April 2023. How can you use $DIB? You can stake $DIBs into the DIB pools for the highest APY (Annual Percentage Yield). You can also use $DIBs as votes in the future DIB Yield DAO.

		"input": "Game Rules Introduction: LAST SENDER is a game based on a countdown mechanism. The game is managed by a smart contract hosted on the ARBITRUM blockchain. Objective of the game The objective of the game is to be the last user to send a transaction to the smart contract before the countdown reaches 0 (expired). The last user to send a transaction wins 80% of the smart contract's balance. Game rules The countdown lasts 200 seconds. Users can send transactions to the smart contract at any time. After the countdown expires, the 'SEND' button is disabled and the smart contract no longer accepts incoming transactions until the game is RESTARTED. The 'SEND' button sends a transaction with a fixed amount (predetermined by the contract owner) to the smart contract. When a transaction arrives at the smart contract, the countdown is reset and starts over from 200 seconds. The address that sent the transaction is set as the last sender. If no incoming transactions arrive, the countdown reaches 0 (expired) and the last winning sender wins 80% of the balance. When the countdown expires at 0 (expired), the 'RESTART' button is activated. The user who first presses the 'RESTART' button calls the smart contract function responsible for restarting the countdown, clearing the last sender and sending the prizes to the respective addresses. Prizes 80% of the smart contract's balance is awarded to the last winning sender. 15% of the balance is awarded to the contract owner. 1% of the balance is awarded to the user who, by pressing the 'RESTART' button, calls the game's RESTART function first. The remaining 4% remains in the balance for the next round. Disclaimer The game is a gambling game and carries the risk of losing money. Players are responsible for their own actions. Good luck and have fun! Connect with Log Out SEND Eth to be Last Sender RESTART first and receive Eth Change Amount, ",

Call us at (877) 355-3585 Names for sale Edit Mode MiniShib.com This domain name is for sale Hear how MiniShib.com sounds Hear how it sounds Check Brand Alignment Make an offer for this domain Your offer must be higher than $15,910 Make an Offer Clear and upfront pricing so that you can purchase the domains with confidence Transparent Pricing We initiate most domain transfers within same business day of the purchase Same Day Transfers 100% Purchase Protection Guarantee. Receive full refund if we are unable to trans fer the domain for any reason Guaranteed Delivery About MiniShib.com In 1993, the U.S. Department of Commerce, in conjunction with several public and private entities, created InterNIC to maintain a central database that contains all the registered domain names and the associated IP addresses in the U.S. (other countries maintain their own NICs (Network Information Centers) -- there's a link below that discusses Canada's system, for example). Network Solutions, a member of InterNIC, was chosen to administer and maintain the growing number of Internet domain names and IP addresses. This central database is copied to Top Level Domain (TLD) servers around the world and creates the primary routing tables used by every computer that connects to the Internet. Each ICANN-accredited registrar must pay a fixed fee of US$4,000 plus a variable fee. The sum of variable registrar fees is intended to total US$3.8 million. The competition created by the shared registration system enables end users to choose from many registrars offering a range of related services at varying prices. Designated registrar Domain registration information is maintained by the domain name registries, which contract with domain registrars to provide registration services to the public. An end user selects a registrar to provide the registration service, and that registrar becomes the designated registrar for the domain chosen by the user. Only the designated registrar may modify or delete information about domain names in a central registry database. It is not unusual for an end user to switch registrars, invoking a domain transfer process between the registrars involved, that is governed by specific domain name transfer policies. When a registrar registers a com domain name for an end-user, it must pay a maximum annual fee of US$7.34 to VeriSign, the registry operator for com, and a US$0.18 annual administration fee to ICANN. Most domain registrars price their services and products to address both the annual fees and the administration fees that must be paid to ICANN. Barriers to entry into the bulk registrar industry are high for new companies without an existing customer base. Many registrars also offer registration through reseller affiliates. An end-user registers either directly with a registrar, or indirectly through one or more layers of resellers. As of 2010, the retail cost generally ranges from a low of about $7.50 per year to about $35 per year for a simple domain registration, although registrars often drop the price far lower when ordered with other products such as web hosting services. The maximum period of registration for a domain name is 10 years. Some registrars offer longer periods of up to 100 years, but such offers involve the registrar renewing the registration for their customer; the 100-year registration would not be in the official registration database.

		"input": "Home About Us White paper Tokens Releases and law RU | EN | CN MARKETS AND RESOURCES Token with basic profitability How do I get a token? Decentralized token Combining the cryptoindustry and the real sector of the economy Decentralized cross-platform project that unites the crypto industry and the real sector of the economy. Created by the community for the community. The 'SANTRAST' project is a tool that will unite the assets of Russian and European companies involved in advanced high-tech sectors of the economy and the entire business community. At the time of the release of the 'SNR' token, the project is at the start-up stage. Token holders will be participants in a financial innovation that has no analogues. The SNR token is the world's first blockchain project with a basic return. The proceeds will be used to increase the asset base of the project and support high-tech start-ups, the development of medicine, renewable energy, environmental protection and restoration. SNRW is part of the SANTRAST project, it is an asset with a variable value, interacts with the SNR contract and the PANGOLIN DEX protocol, is designed to hedge investor positions, increase liquidity by recalculating cross rates, preventing a decrease in liquidity during market downturns and increasing it during rallies. It has a super high yield. $1445507 (+251%) Total Liquidity $7775+ Volume (24hrs) KEY FEATURES How it works? To do this, you need to open a pool of SNR / SNRW liquidity, since initially the investor does not have these coins, he will need to exchange any asset for SNRW, then part of the SNRW will need to be exchanged for SNR. After that, you can open the SNR / SNRW pool As a result of these actions, the following occurs SNR is in an isolated state and cross-rate recalculations on it are not carried out and investors receive an increased number of liquidity tokens, which leads to increased commissions The total amount of earned fees thus becomes a reserve pool that can change depending on market fluctuations and keeps the main SNR / SNRW pool unchanged even if it is not traded and increases liquidity during its rise increasing the total fees SNR and SNRW contracts interact with each other only in the liquidity pool and regardless of which of these assets is in higher demand, this invariably leads to an increase in the value of all pools opened in a pair with SNRW Investor provides additional liquidity to SNRW pools The cost of SNRW and SNR increases WHAT'S IN THE TOTAL? The advantages of this strategy In order for investors to start earning income, it is necessary to provide liquidity to the WAVAX / SNRW, PNG / SNRW pools and the main SNR / SNRW pool. The higher the liquidity provided in the WAVAX / SNRW and PNG / SNRW pools, the higher the profitability in the main SNR / SNRW pool. As shown in the screenshot below, you can make sure that the total revenue exceeds the total value of all pools. Ultra-high yield Absolute freedom of action No restrictions on time and capital size No risks associated with blocking liquidity on third-party services The ability to launch absolutely any projects without all sorts of details of registration and confirmation of programming skills Easy to connect Instructions Don't waste your time Buy Now! SNR & SNRW SANTRAST The ecosystem of the project is built on our multiplier, which includes a system of interaction between cryptography and the real sector of the economy, as well as making a profit for the followers and participants of the project. In previous years, cryptography has undergone many transformations and with the advent of DeFi protocols, solving our problems has become dramatically simpler, in fact, our idea of requiring the development of many tools is shifted to DeFi technology and will be spread in this area. The idea is based on the fact that the entire system of the crypto industry is self-contained and has excess liquidity. In fact, what is happening is caused by the uncontrollable growth of bitcoin, as well as its systematic ups and downs associated with the computing power for its production and maintenance of the network itself. In turn, the rest of the altcoins follow its market movement. The true interpretation of 'White Paper' is to consider the Russian version of the presentation of the text!

Our mainnet runs Binance Smart Chain applications with 2-second transaction finality and 100 times lower fees. YFWs secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum, Binance Smart chain and other chains. YFW serves as a platform for creators to connect with their community. Try our showcase below an NFT marketplace with collectibles from hundreds of artists. 0x183a39d8d1B3ffFE176e09537485B49F3f48Cb45 Add to wallet AutoBoost is a one of a kind function that has been built into our contract. Some are familiar with buy back tokens, our token is not just another buy back token. YFW AutoBoost function is built mathematically to do variable buybacks which adjust based on volume in order to maintain stability. AutoBoost will vary based on the transactions over the past 24 hours which will continue to adjust based on the volume. AutoBoost will buy back variable amounts every time a sale occurs with YFW token.This is a one of a kind function which is more powerful than just a standard buyback token.. Token sale info Total sale quantity: 800000000000 Token price: 0.0000000002 BNB (5B tokens per 1 BNB) Tokens sold: Total raised: BNB Unsold tokens: Token sale status: -- Passive Income via Yield Farming Wallet YFW Most of the project profit will be directly in the pocket of the investors. The Casino's income is divided between the token holders, and the value of the token can rise in an infinite way as the platform is more known among the games and played by more players. %20 of the casino's profit is dedicated to 'Token Buy Back' process which will be burnt several times a year and will automatically cause a explosion in the value of the YFW tokens during a year. Tokens can also be used in the platform itself, which can also make the value of the tokens grow enormously. The value of our token is directly related to the popularity of the casino. The more popular the platform gets, the more the casino profits, and finally, the more value the tokens carry. This is the first time in the history of DeFi projects that a project's token values are certainly predicted to grow.

The Backstop AMM (B.AMM) enables users to deposit funds into backstop pools, and this liquidity is used to execute liquidations on integrated platforms. Once a liquidation takes place the smart contract pulls the needed funds from the backstop to facilitate the liquidation, and automatically puts the seized collateral for sale.

You must have heard people referring to some of these digital assets as coins and the rest as “tokens”. The truth is cryptocurrency includes more than simply those coins which can be speculated upon or “mined”. Crypto assets are essentially those which can be created on a blockchain and have intrinsic value. Cryptos use cryptographic techniques and are emerging as a possible alternative to traditional fiat currencies. However, they do not get their values from banks or centralized authorities. Rather, they are decentralized and not controlled by any government or financial institution. You can choose from 3 main types of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin: This is a completely decentralized peer-to-peer payment system created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Its market cap is more than $100 billion and currently prices hover around $66,000. The Bitcoin is powered by the blockchain technology and not backed by any government. It can be used for transferring money between parties without intervention by a third party and can also be easily traded via auto trading bots like bitcoin prime crypto robot. Not just that, bitcoins can be traded on almost all crypto exchanges and by trading bots, as its one of the popular cryptocurrencies. You only need a computer and wallet for transfers. A single Bitcoin may be split into 8 decimal places and the smallest unit is a “Satoshi”. The blockchain is run by multiple users through a P2P network. Rather than any central organization verifying transactions, it is verified at the same time by everyone on the blockchain. Users from anywhere on the globe can conduct transactions once they solve complex cryptographic puzzles. All validated transactions are added to this blockchain in a chronological order. This means transactions cannot be deleted, changed, or duplicated; they are totally transparent. So, the Bitcoin shares all the key qualities of fiat currencies like divisibility, fungibility, portability, and scarcity. Moreover, Bitcoin can be purchased on almost all crypto exchanges and trading bots. Purchasing bitcoin is no longer hard or confusing as users can also buy BTC with iTunes card now. Altcoins: These offer competition to the Bitcoin and claim to be its better versions. Some of these altcoins operate in the same way as the Bitcoin, using the blockchain with simple tweaks. Some altcoins, however, have been created from major deviations from the Proof-of-Work algorithm which the Bitcoin endorses. Instead, they use a Proof-of-Stake method/smart contracts for verifying transactions. The Ethereum or NEO are types of altcoins allowing you to build blockchain-based apps on their platforms. The smart contracts are essentially self-executing contracts with terms of reference coded into the blockchain directly. These execute instructions once specific conditions have been met. The only downside is that altcoins do not have the kind of acceptance that Bitcoin has. Tokens/dApps: These are becoming rather popular, issuing many ICOs annually since innovators find these more effective. These let you decentralize almost anything using the smart contracts. DApps refer to decentralized applications which do not operate through a single system; a dApp will operate on a blockchain/P2P platform. Since dApps are platform-independent, they offer many more opportunities for blockchain efforts. Instead of having a blockchain, they use smart contracts for running commands and getting information from blockchain systems. For rewarding users, dApps reward native tokens which may be exchanged for real money. These are the different types of cryptocurrencies these days which new investors should be aware of. Many more are expected to enter the crypto scene in the future.

About BlockCities was inspired by CryptoKitties and the erc721 token standard created in late 2017. At the time, I was a digital artist selling physical prints to profit on digital work. But when I saw CryptoKitties, I knew NFTs would change digital art forever. Each building was meticulously designed over the course of two years from 2018 to 2020. They're designed in the classic isometic illustration style pioneered by early 3d games in the 90s, including SimCity. Once designed, buildings were divided into parts, loaded into an SVG generator and paired with on-chain random number generation to create unique generative buildings. Classics are clones of real-world buildings. Specials are custom designed buildings which can be 1 of 1's or limited run duplicates. BlockCities was the first NFT project to instrument demand-based dynamic pricing. When the BlockCities Mystery Machine went live for the first time in April of 2019, prices increased by 0.0003 ETH every time a building was minted and paid for. It decreased by the same amount every 50 blocks a new building was not minted. This was effective on launch day as a surge of mints rolled in, but ineffective longterm as the price decreased significantly between mints. Uniswap's token-bonding modal is a vast improvement on this concept. BlockCities started as collectibles, became a game, and are now just collectibles. They have no utility and never will. You can buy them on Opensea. . Preston Attebery , ",

Properti Bergaya Kasino Las Vegas Mulai Beroperasi di Empat Kota Virginia ug9gh November 8, 2023November 8, 2023 BONUS NEW MEMBER 100% No Comments Properti Bergaya Kasino Las Vegas Mulai Beroperasi di Empat Kota Virginia Ada tiga inisiatif pemungutan suara di Negara Bagian Cornhusker yang mengizinkan perjudian kasino. Menurut laporan di Lincoln Journal-Star, ketiganya menerima suara “ya” dengan mayoritas 2-1. Tiga inisiatif mengubah konstitusi negara bagian untuk mengizinkan perjudian kasino, mengenakan pajak pendapatan darinya dan menggunakannya untuk mengurangi pajak properti. Perkiraan awal adalah bahwa penambahan kasino saja akan menghasilkan pendapatan pajak hampir $65 juta. kasino akan diizinkan di arena pacuan kuda yang ada di Nebraska. Mereka akan dibangun di rute yang ada di Lincoln, Omaha, Grand Island, Columbus, Sioux City dan Hastings. Jika rute baru dibangun di masa depan, kasino juga akan diizinkan. Inilah akhir dari perjalanan sulit para pecinta sepak bola Tanah Air.Musim panas lalu, sebuah kelompok pro-permainan mengumpulkan cukup tanda tangan untuk mengajukan inisiatif tersebut dalam pemungutan suara, namun Menteri Luar Negeri menolak akses mereka. Pada akhirnya, Mahkamah Agung negara bagian membatalkan keputusannya dan mengirimkan keputusan akhir kepada para pemilih. Di Virginia, terdapat kasino bergaya Las Vegas di Danville, Portsmouth, Norfolk, dan Bristol. Berbeda dengan Nebraska, hanya penduduk di empat kota tersebut yang dapat memilih. Siapa pun yang memutuskan untuk mengizinkan kasino kunjungi situs judi Onicbet. Caesars Entertainment akan membangun kasino di Danville dan Hard Rock International akan membangun properti di Bristol. Suku Pamunkey berkesempatan membangun kasino di Norfolk dan Rush Street Gaming akan membangun kasino kelima di Portsmouth. Pemain Kasino Ketat atau Longgar ug9gh November 8, 2023November 8, 2023 BONUS NEW MEMBER 100% No Comments Pemain Kasino Ketat atau Longgar Apakah Anda bermain Ketat atau Longgar? Jelaskan ciri-ciri kontras permainan menggunakan metode diametris ini. Pemain poker ketat berperilaku konvensional dan hanya menelepon atau bertaruh ketika mereka memiliki tangan yang kuat. Jika kegagalan tidak membuat tangan Anda membaik, jangan ragu untuk membuang kartu Anda kecuali Anda memiliki kartu buatan tangan (pra-gagal, yaitu AA, KK dan QQ) atau kartu grafik premium (AK, AQ). , AJ dan KQ). Jika mereka tidak memiliki kartu as di tangannya, mereka sering kali melipat saat kartu as mengenai meja kecuali mereka mengenai sepasang kartu as. Mereka tidak pernah memulai dengan kain Ace dan, jika semuanya berjalan baik, di mana saja. Di sisi lain, pemain yang longgar mungkin menelepon untuk melihat kegagalan dengan hampir dua kartu di lubang dan jarang membuka tangan mereka sebelum kegagalan.Setelah mengalami kemunduran, mereka biasanya mencari jalan keluar untuk menghasilkan uang dari tangan itu dan berharap memenangkan pot. “Bersikaplah seperti angsa!” “Itu keterlaluan. Dalam kedua kasus tersebut, terdapat banyak aktor.” Saya rasa saya tidak perlu memperingatkan Anda tentang pemain agresif.Para pemain ini cenderung sering bertaruh dan menaikkan (atau menaikkan kembali) setiap putaran. “Maniacs” adalah penyerang utama dalam poker; dia menaruh kepercayaannya pada dunia hampir tanpa berpikir panjang. Pemain lepas mungkin agresif atau tidak. Meskipun pada kenyataannya, pemain yang ketat lebih cenderung bermain agresif dalam kondisi tertentu jika ia yakin kenaikan gaji akan menguntungkannya kunjungi situs judi Onicbet. Apakah Anda lebih suka bermain ketat, longgar dan/atau agresif? Kami menandai “struktur” tabel (permainan).Apa cara terbaik untuk memastikan sesi sukses? Beberapa kesalahan agresif dengan cepat menentukan struktur permainan, sementara pengaruh pemain yang serius semakin berkurang. Kapal pesiar mendarat saat Las Vegas dibuka kembali sebuah ujian besar bagi kasino ug9gh November 8, 2023November 8, 2023 BONUS NEW MEMBER 100% No Comments Kapal pesiar mendarat saat Las Vegas dibuka kembali sebuah ujian besar bagi kasino Meskipun tantangan pelacakan kontak di Las Vegas sangat ekstrem, hal ini menyoroti masalah yang lebih besar dan sistemik dalam melacak virus corona di seluruh negeri. Itu adalah salah satu konferensi besar terakhir sebelum pandemi virus corona menutup kasino-kasino besar di Las Vegas Strip pada bulan Maret. Lebih dari 1.000 orang berkumpul di Mirage Hotel & Casino di MGM Resorts International untuk Musim Panas Wanita setelah penyelenggara meyakinkan bahwa menghadiri acara rseautage “sangat berisiko bagi para manajer perempuan di negara tersebut.” Tampaknya asumsi tersebut masuk akal mengingat belum ada satu pun kasus infeksi virus corona di Las Vegas. Tidak ada yang tahu bahwa salah satu pembicara, seorang warga New York, telah tertular virus sebelum mendarat di Bandara Internasional McCarran pada 6 Maret.Dua hari kemudian dia berada di rumah sakit.

Kartu remi menghadiahi mereka dengan detail halus di meja kasino ug9gh November 4, 2023November 4, 2023 BONUS NEW MEMBER 100% No Comments Kartu remi menghadiahi mereka dengan detail halus di meja kasino meskipun kartu remi didukung oleh keberanian dan kesederhanaan desain keseluruhannya bagi mereka yang tertarik dengan desain yang muncul dari pertimbangan yang cermat. Jembatan sepeda adalah model yang bagus di sini karena meskipun ciri dua lingkaran simetris langsung dapat dikenali pada gambar utama, setelah memeriksa detailnya dengan cermat, kami menemukan malaikat di atas sepeda. Namun dalam hal pengembalian kartu, yang paling penting adalah pendapat pribadi Anda mengenai kartu tersebut. Apakah menurut Anda ini orisinal dan kreatif? Apakah Anda langsung tertarik menjadi cantik atau menarik?Tentu saja, desain artistik sebuah kartu sering kali dikaitkan dengan tema keseluruhan permainan, tetapi apa yang menurut Anda indah juga memiliki komponen yang sangat pribadi. Beberapa deck menampilkan tinta metalik di bagian belakang kartu, yang secara instan menciptakan tampilan yang benar-benar unik dan elegan, dan kilau terlihat saat kartu memantulkan cahaya pada sudut tertentu kunjungi situs judi Onicbet. Dibawa ke ekstrim, beberapa deck pergi babi penuh serta foil logam panas dicap dibagian belakang. Ini nampak super eksklusif serta mengagumkan, tapi diperlengkapi dengan dua kekurangan. Pertama, bentuk foil yang dicap panas terkadang bisa dibawa masuk serta nampak dibagian depan kartu. Ke-2, foil condong semakin licin, serta ini akan seringkali berefek pada perlakuan kartu. Tetapi itu meningkatkan banyak bling instant ke geladak, serta punggung foil nampak benar-benar mengagumkan!

Gubernur mengatakan akan memakan waktu dua hingga tiga minggu untuk menilai situasi di negara bagian tersebut secara menyeluruh, namun ia juga menyatakan bahwa ia tidak mengharapkan sesuatu yang konkret. “Saya belum punya indikator konkrit untuk lolos ke tahap kedua,” kata Sisolak.“Jika kami menemui masalah dengan salah satu inisiatif yang saya usulkan selama pembukaan ini dan kami dapat mengidentifikasi aktivitas yang menyebabkan peningkatan ini, kami akan membatalkan beberapa seruan yang diumumkan hari ini.” “Kita hidup di masa yang belum pernah terjadi sebelumnya dan memerlukan tindakan yang belum pernah terjadi sebelumnya,” kata Sandra Morgan, Ketua Dewan Kontrol Gaming. “Kami yakin kebijakan ini masuk akal tidak hanya bagi pemegang lisensi kami, namun juga bagi karyawan dan tamu kami.

Terlepas dari kapan perjudian dibuka kembali, fakta bahwa jadwalnya telah dimajukan seminggu adalah pertanda baik bagi perusahaan kasino kunjungi situs judi Onicbet.

Our games are built using the Polygon Blockchain and all transactions from players winning crypto from our games can be easily viewed via Polygonscan providing full transparency. What are Play To Earn games (P2E) in Web3 Play to earn games differ from the usual play to win games where you are rewarded through in game achievements or simply bragging rights.

Web3 brings a variety of different use cases whereas within the world of gaming, it allows a user to connect to a gaming platform like ours through your wallet, play games staking a small amount of crypto ($CHAIN) against your opponent and if you win, you are rewarded through a refund of your staked $CHAIN Token in addition to your opponent's $CHAIN token minus transactional fees. If you would like to create your crypto wallet to start using our play to earn blockchain based games, you can create one via Metamask.io Chain Games is a blockchain-integrated Web3 gaming network that allows for decentralized game of skills contests with real crypto payouts.

Christopher Chapman Experience Architect - Decentraland Crowdsale Crowdsale Crowdsale Explainer Explainer Explainer Recent Blogposts Learn how Chainbreakers enables players to monetize playtime and progress Chainbreakers is a blockchain gaming franchise created by the webvr studio Qwellcode. The project was started in early 2018. During ETHBuenoAires in late May 2018, we showcased an early prototype to the Decentraland team. Our strategy-rpg should become one of the launch titles of the metaverse. Items and units that can be acquired by the player are stored in non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These ERC-721 tokens are saved to the Ethereum blockchain. The complete game design is written in smart contracts that utilize the tokenized game assets in a transparent and trustful way.

Open Archive Smart Contract enabled Gamedesign About Chainbreakers Intro Story Gameplay Reward Pools Technology Chainbreakers is a strategy-rpg that integrates cryptocurrencies and digitally scarced game assets by design. Players are incentivised to earn MANA rewards by actively playing the game and strategically develop their assets. While the backend runs on the Ethereum blockchain and is programmed in Solidity smart contracts, the games virtual reality front-end will be accessed from the Decentraland metaverse. The games quest areas will be deployed around the metaverse which requires the players to travel as the storyline progresses. Chainbreakers partners up with Decentraland land investors. For them it will be possible to receive MANA for hosting quest areas on their parcels. The number of rewards depends on the revenue generated on the hosted scene. Learn how to get started in Chainbreakers. Chainbreakers is set in Ancient Greece, during the reign of a cruel government. Players enter the world and are tasked with supporting the rebellion. Gameplay elements include gathering suppressed slaves and integrate them into the players rebel squad to lean against the tyrannic system, claiming items and loot, and forging partnerships with other rebels to embark on the most dangerous challenges in the realm. Stories about legendary relics and powerful items in mythological dungeons get spread throughout all levels of greek society. Units are executing orders while strategic leaders systematically train of units and acquire certain items to be prepared for more ambitious quests. Learn how to get started in Chainbreakers. The player hires units and can level them in three different roles by sending them to quests. Units can be equipped with items that increase stats and enhance the chance to successfully solve quests to obtain loot and more experience. Quests that require more than one unit slot can always be attended in multiplayer mode. Endgame raids require lots of high level units which forces the community to actively collaborate. Those units need to be trained in several roles to fit the requirements of the quest slots. A pvp mode is planned and will be implemented as soon as state-channel technology has matured. Learn how to get started in Chainbreakers. Each quest area has a reward pool that is filled with MANA from the revenue is generated through gameplay: a percentage of the MANA spent in different questing areas is contributed to these reward pools. A certain percentage of this MANA pool is then periodically set aside for the players in that quest area. The amount of the rewards are calculated based on how much experience different units earn, and can be withdrawn at any time. To save gas fees, players can withdraw their MANA rewards every other period (or less). Items contribute a large chunk to the total power of a unit and can be passed down to lower level units once out-leveled. By managing units in multiple questing areas, players can maximize their rewards. So, more powerful items can be considered as a more valuable long term investments.

The WebVR game will be playable on desktop, mobile and VR headset. Any greeting, conversation and quest description is translated into an audio file by an AI based text-to-speech algorithm to spare the players eyes while playing in VR.

Professional Execution Team and Partners Our Studio Partners Advisory The Germany-based virtual reality studio Qwellcode is actively developing Chainbreakers. The company currently employs 15 people and focuses on the development of blockchain games and webvr solutions. The first version of Chainbreakers has been demoed at ETHBuenosAires in May 2018. After talking about our ideas and plans, we decided to make Chainbreakers a Decentraland launch title. Since then we've expanded our community to over thousand members. The first Chainbreakers title will be launched on Decentraland in September 2019 before the team focuses on the next title. Chainbreakers is currently raising the seed round for their next title. The upcoming 3D blockchain game aims to bring MMORPG feeling to the browser. Feel free to request a deck. Chainbreakers is going to be VR launch title for Decentraland. Our team has been working with them for months and beliefs in the pioneering implementation of their decentralized metaverse. Chainbreakers will integrate the Matic Network plasma EVM side-chain to provide second layer scalability. With Opensea and Matic we can build blockchain-based trade interfaces and auction houses that can be accessed from our 3D browser dapp. We've also partnered with Portis. This project allows users to register and login to web3 with an email adress and password. This vastly reduces onboarding barriers and allows cross-device gameplay. An OpenSea integration is going to provide a smooth crowdsale and more importantly a reliable and trustworthy second market for Chainbreakers player base. The Chainbreakers auction house will utilize their smart contracts for example.

DocumentationLaunch App The Composability Protocol Thats Sparking a DeFi Revolution Charged Particles is the groundbreaking protocol that lets you put digital assets inside your NFTs. Now, ordinary NFTs (think neutral molecules) can contain a digital 'charge' inside — ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 — giving you the unprecedented power to create nested NFTs. If you can digitize it, you can deposit it into your NFTs. What is particlon? Particlon is the first generative NFT drop from Charged Particles, powered by VASI (Virtual Art Systems & Integration). Each avatar has its own unique attributes which correlate with the planet they derive from. MINT NOW Igniting Endless NFT Possibilities Projects DeFi Platforms Creators DAO's For Projects Embed functional utility into your NFTs and set your project apart. Add composability into your ecosystem to enable possibilities such as brand new DeFi mechanics, gamification, time-locked tokens, and more! For DeFi Interest-bearing DeFi NFTs, time-locked vesting capsules, trust funds, bonds, and NFTs filled with whole portfolios of assets. Make your DeFi tool kit significantly more robust with Charged Particles. For Platforms Looking to build the next wave of blockchain innovation? Composability is a vital layer of the Web 3.0 stack. Whether its art, music, gaming, fashion, finance, or infrastructure, youll want the NFTs on your platform to be as cutting edge as they come. For Creators From bundled assets and collections of works to immersive storytelling and community-oriented games, Nested NFTs let you build new depth into your creations.

You have the option to time-lock the interest-bearing tokens and come back to it in a year, or another designated amount of time to collect your cumulative gains.Learn More Use Case 02 Nested NFTs Create a brand new asset class known as a Nested NFT. Bring to life a collection of NFTs all housed within one single NFT. These can hold not only layers of value, but even deeper meaning as well. Empowering artists and creators. The only limit is your imagination. Collaborating in new ways, telling complex stories intertwined, all inside the NFT.

The power of the in-game item could be dependent on the amount of 'charge' the NFT holds. Charged Particles has the potential to eliminate the whole 'Pay to Win' mechanic of gaming. Even a “Common” item can eventually build up enough power (via its charge) to compete with legendary items without paying for it.Learn More Use Case 04 Gift Basket You can create an NFT and use it as a repository for your family members growing crypto stash.

Note that only a number of Servants equal to the current ORDER are able to act in that ORDER. 【Action restrictions】 Ex) Up to two Servants on can act on ORDER 2. If three Servants are set to ORDER 2, then 1 cannot act. On matching ORDER values, actions are prioritized in order of Recovery>Magic>Attack>Defense. Furthermore, the Servant with higher POW has priority if the items above match, and when even POW matches, order is decided at random. When you have a Servant with the same ORDER as one on the enemy side, the offensive side for the ROUND will act first. Depending on JOB, Servants may have ROUNDS they can and cannot act on. Magic Users can only act on even numbered turns, while Recovery can only act on odd numbered turns.【Action limits per job】 【Action restrictions】【Action limits per job】Servants enter ''Idle'' state, and cannot act. Target locations and ranges are set by Servant DNA. Attacks will miss if there are no Servants present in target ranges when battle begins, but targeting changes as shown below with each ROUND. ROUND 1: DNA search (searches for enemies in spots set by DNA only) ROUND 2: Row search (target moves a row back if nothing was found during DNA search. If starting from middle row, middle row > back row > front row) ROUND 3 and on: General search (targeting moves until a target is found) *See below for targeting priority Taunted Servants ignore targeting logic and make the taunter their main target (starting point). Furthermore, this can strike other Servants, since sub-targeting (range) does not change even if the main target moves. *If multiple taunts are active at once: Servant taunts are prioritized by placement in 1. Front row > middle row > back row. 2. If the above are the same, the Servant closest to the enemy side's initial target will be prioritized. 3.

As the draw of these elemental powers radiate from the new realm, the Primordial Crabs lying dormant have emerged to reclaim their dominance over the elements. LEARN MORE Follow us to get the latest updates and rewards. Battle, Mutate and Unleash CryptantCrab is a Crypto game developed by award winning game developer Appxplore (iCandy) that goes beyond just a collection game. As a spinoff from the highly successful Crab War, it takes a giant leap towards the future of Crypto gaming! The concept of this crypto sport is inspired by the popular traditional ‘Betta Fish Fight, a hobby that originates from Southeast Asia and is even recognized by the King of Thailand. Just as each fighting fish has their own unique combination of colours, patterns and fins, CryptantCrabs have their own unique markings, parts and elements that reimagine the concept of the fighting fish. Train, mutate or challenge the multitude of Crabs and watch as you gain the appreciation of other CryptantCrab Challengers from across the world. Your one-of-a-kind CryptantCrab will have a chance to go down in history as a sought-after legend that turns your time spent on it into an investment of irreplaceable value. Turn The Elemental Tide Each Crab hatched in this world of untamed elements infuses them with powers beyond imagination. Be it Water, Spirit, Fire, Metal or Earth, crab body parts are each empowered by an element of their own. Participate in intense elemental clashes and mutate elemental combinations in your Crabs to turn the tide of battle in your favour. Battle for Glory Take on other Crabs with claw to claw combat and gain recognition in each successive victory. Scale the ladder to greatness as you unleash your Crabs potential on the battlefield and crush the competition. With the spoils of battle as your prize and glory as your catalyst, the destiny of your Crabs greatness is in your hands. Grow Beyond Collection The growth of your CryptantCrab is all tied to your decentralized Crab on the blockchain. This means that all the battle experience, mutations and legendary parts invested into your CryptantCrab follow it wherever it goes. This opens up a host of opportunities for additional integrations and multiplayer aspects that would not diminish or manipulate your CryptantCrab. All aspects of growth are well recorded and will allow you to increase the strength of your CryptantCrab and in turn its value. Will your Crab reach the apex of its growth and go down in history as that legendary CryptantCrab? It all starts here! Appxplore (iCandy) Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

While some altars are controlled by us, most are player run, and players can set their fees as they see fit.

MAGICAL CYBERPUNK The game world, Kyra, was long ago bound by the magical Edict has taken hold. Set forth long ago, the Edict limits the power of the spell: the more people able to use it, the weaker the spell becomes. An entity, the Iridium Corporation, has risen up to take advantage of this societal element, and in so doing, has become the dominant political and socioeconomic force in Rathe, the hub capital of Kyra.

		"input": "CryptocommandersInventoryReferralsWhitepapers War is coming Be ready for battle!! Buy Units to conquer territories and expand control over more territories by earning rewards. How to Play 01. PURCHASE UNITS (ON THE BLOCKCHAIN!) Use Ethereum to buy units on the blockchain! Every unit is a unique, tradeable ERC-721 token. Purchase units from our Early bird Sale below and get a headstart on building your army. Units can be combined together to form more powerful units. They also will not be destroyed if they die in battle! They will just go back to your inventory to be repaired for a few hours. 02. ONE WORLD WITH ALL THE PLAYERS Enter a huge 3D world with thousands of players. Units will be moving in real-time to capture territory, mine resources and battle other units. Units from your inventory will start at the edge of the map. A unit must refuel for 3 hours after every move and has a max distance that it can travel at a time. Ground units will need to avoid water, trees, mountains and other ground units while aerial units will be able to fly over most obstacles. 03. CAPTURE TERRITORY & WIN ETHEREUM Every unit owns the land in a radius around them. The more territory a player owns, the more they are rewarded. A player will be rewarded daily with Ethereum based on the amount of land they owned throughout that day. Also, a satellite will drop from the sky once a day that contains a huge reward. If that satellite lands within a player's territory, they will receive a ton of Ethereum! 04. REWARDS INCREASE TOWARDS THE CENTER Not all land is created equal! The world is divided into rings. As you travel towards the center, each ring contains more valuable land and the satellite also has an increased chance of landing there. You'll need to increase your units' star-rating to access the inner rings. Fusing 3 units of the same type will increase its star-rating. Also, older units will collect more land rewards. 05. RESOURCES, ALLIANCES & CRAFT Resources are used to unlock amazing upgrades and eventually crafting. They will appear randomly on the map and you must use units to mine them. Defend your resources from others to get ahead. Joining a strong alliance will be key to coordinating attacks, defenses and bases. Cryptocommanders Public sale beginning soon, head to discord to participate in giveaways! CryptoCommanders are avatars with special abilities that can be used to enhance your units and help you gain dominance in the battlefield! Each one is a unique generative piece of art and there can only be a maximum of 11,111 ever created. Any not sold during the drop will be burned once the sale ends. Screenshots Here's a look at the game-in-progress. You can get a closer look at the units, resources, and terrain. Our world will be able to handle tons of players and will grow accordingly. Check back soon as we'll be updating this section often! Referral Code Make 5% from all purchases from anyone who uses your link. The transfer of Ethereum is automatic and happens through the smart contract.

The octopus has this ability, too. It can detach an arm in order to distract predators, and then grow a new one in its place, which is quite a luxury when you have eight arms.Fun Fact: It has been observed in captivity that octopuses like shiny objects.

Shoot! How is Dragonereum different from other cryptogames? Unlike the majority of cryptogames, Dragonereum has advanced game economy together with comprehensive game features and mechanics. That includes breeding, fighting, training, trading, an in-game cryptocurrency and a limited dragon population. How do I get a Genesis dragon? The best option to get a Genesis dragon is to participate in Genesis egg distribution. If you miss out and dont manage to grab a free egg then dont despair, you can still get one after the event from someone who was smart enough to join us for Genesis. How many eggs will be available to claim during Genesis? There will be 10K eggs, comprising of 5 different dragon types, each with a unique set of skills and abilities, make sure you choose wisely! How long is the Genesis event estimated to go on for? First 5000 Genesis eggs will be available for a claim once per block. Next 1250 Genesis eggs will be available for a claim once every 2 blocks. Next 1250 Genesis eggs will be available for a claim once every 4 blocks. Next 1250 Genesis eggs will be available for a claim once every 8 blocks. Next 1250 Genesis eggs will be available for a claim once every 16 blocks. Therefore, the Genesis event will last for 42500 blocks, or approximately 7 days. What if there are no transactions received for a certain block? In this case an egg will be moved to the next block and will be available to be claimed at any moment afterwards. How do I know that my transaction was successful? Once the transaction is mined you will see a notification in the dapp with the information whether your transaction was successful or not. Will the player know what egg he is going for or will it be random? Yes, the different types of eggs (water, fire, air, earth, and cyber) will be distributed on a sequential basis so the player will be able to see the type of an egg he is bidding for on the Genesis page. How many eggs will the developers keep? Everyone will have the same possibilities during Genesis. The development team will not have any advantage over other players and will not have any eggs distributed to them. You will be able to check this out once smart contracts are published. Do I have to buy the in-game Gold? What is it used for? During Genesis, an egg will be distributed with the required amount of Gold to hatch it, however, if you buy a Genesis egg on the marketplace then you will also need to purchase Gold in order to hatch your dragon, this is why the Genesis event is so important to try get ahead in the game. Gold is also required to buy the special skills from other dragon masters in order to take your dragon to the top ranks. How do dragon genetics work? There are five inter-breedable dragon types, dominant and recessive genes, genome mutations, gene penalties for incest. Take a look at our whitepaper to get down to the nitty-gritty. How will battles be held? The animated battle will be a series of attack/defense dragon moves. Everything will be computed on-chain based on the genetics and skills of each dragon. Can I use my dragons and Gold from the beta in the mainnet? Unfortunately, no. What happens in testnet, stays in testnet, but players who took part in the testnet will have the advantage of already knowing the way the game works.

REFLECTIONS 1% rewards on each transaction are distrubuted to Marvin token holders, with higher rewards for larger holdings. A portion of each transaction is also automatically sent to the burn address, decreasing the overall token supply and increasing value for holders. LIQUIDITY 1% of every transaction is added to liquidity, which helps to keep the floor price of the token high and reduces the effects of large sell orders. This protects both you and the token from potential manipulation by whales during periods of high trading volume. MARKETING A marketing fee of 8% is applied to every transaction to fund token growth and development. These funds cover expenses such as marketing, listings, and community prizes. The Marketing wallet can also burn tokens or add liquidity to support token stability and value. *The tax rate may be altered in response to fluctuations in the market or to achieve specific marketing objectives.

All characters will start with full health, and will fight until the health of one fighter is reduced to 0. Once this has happened, the character is considered knocked out, and the round is lost. When the time limit for the round is reached, the victory is awarded to the player with the most health. Trailer Game Guide - Movement Trailer Game Guide - Combos Trailer Game Guide - Special How to Play To begin a match, each of the participating players must have access to at least one character, which can be purchased from the ETH Fighter Store.

It's also a DApp (Decentralized App) based on Ethereum, now running on Matic Network. Each player controls a pirate ship and aims to survive in a sea arena where other pirates try to destroy ships and collect precious items from the seas to earn points and crypto. At the end of every year there will be a Grand Tournament. To qualify you need to be on top of the leaderboard, win a qualifying tournament or get a special ticket... We also plan to add several NFTs representing collectible game items. To learn more check our quick guide here. REMEMBER: Points are updated and payments are done using Matic Network main net transactions that can take some time. Also don't forget that this is still Beta software. The story 2048... our planet is a very different place. Climate change intensified in the 20's and 30's and caused all the land ice on the planet to melt by 2035. This dramatically reshaped the continents and drowned many of the world's major cities. Then came 2039 and a nuclear hollocaust of unknown reason. Now much of the remaining land is a nuclear wasteland and most of the survivors live in small islands or floating communities known as harbors. Most of the technology and knowledge were lost. The seas are now a dangerous place, full of pirates and their clans. In 2048 mysterious purple stones, with unknown origin, started to appear in the seas. One of the most respectful community leaders, Lord Buterin understood their power... He made a challenge to the pirates around it's harbor: a Grand Tournament in a sea arena to find out who's the greatest stone collector!

Once a player sets foot on the surface, a Planet becomes explored and is divided into Sectors that can be acquired to construct a Base and extract Resources. Starmap Unique Collection Spaceships are the main mode of transportation in the Farsite universe. Ships are created in various color schemes, can be modified with Modules and customized with prints. Every Ship Is Unique Each and every Ship is destroyable, can be bought and sold in-game or on external exchanges.

		"input": "HOGSMASH ! MY HOG RANKING BATTLE ! BATTLE RESULT ! MARKETPLACE Shop LOG IN What is HogSmash? HogSmash is a game about nurturing hogs on the ethereum blockchain (contract here) and battling for the top spot. Here you don't breed hogs. You create value by fighting and leveling up. These hogs cannot be taken away or destroyed and they grow according to how you train them. You might be able to win Ether from dethroning others from their rank too! Play Reload BASICS Learn your stats, this is a game of skills! Attack : The damage that you will deal to your opponent every time you attack. Defense : The shield that will block the damage before it hits you. If your defense is higher than the opponent's attack, you will still take a 1 HP damage. Speed : This is will be the main factor to determine who hits first. If your speed is higher than your opponent, there is a higher percentage that you will hit first, the higher the better. Critical Rate : This is the rate that will incur a double attack on your opponent, ouch! This maxes out at 70%. HP : The health of your hog, you will lose once it reaches 0 during a fight. Flexi Gem : The gems that you stacked away during level up so to power up any stats when you challenge others. NOTE: Flexi Gems can be used unlimited times but only when you challenge others. Element : Like the chart above shows, each element has an advantage over some other element. If your hog has an advantage element over your opponent, you will be given an extra 30% critical rate and it will max out at 80%. Challenge Tokens : To challenge someone to a battle, you will need to submit some challenge tokens. The tokens required double up once the opponent is within top 150. If you win, you will be able to get back your challenge tokens (minus the developer fees). Rank : To move up the ranking table, you will need to challenge and win someone who has a higher rank than you. You will swap ranks if you win. If you challenge someone who is lower in rank than you and you happen to lose, don't worry, your rank will remain the same. Rank Token : At times when we have events, we will distribute rank tokens to part of the ranking table. There are two ways to win rank tokens. One is to take the place of that rank. The other is when you have rank tokens on your rank, just move up the rank table to get the rank tokens before someone else beats you to it. Note that privilege is given to top 50 hogs. They will be able to collect their own rank tokens and also opponent's rank tokens even by winning over those lower in rank than them, provided that the opponent rank is within top 150. HOW TO START Desktop Mobile Step 1 Install Metamask Install Metamask Step 2 Top-up Ether (ETH) You will need Ether (ETH) to play this game. Step 3 Let's Play Play smart and test your skills. Play Step 1 Install ToShi/Cipher Install ToShi/Cipher Step 2 Top-up Ether (ETH) You will need Ether (ETH) to play this game. Step 3 Let's Play Play smart and test your skills. Play FAQ Q1. I challenged someone but I don't see any battle history, what went wrong? There are a couple of reasons why you are not seeing your battle history. 1. It's most likely that your transaction is still pending. If you want a faster transaction, try paying a higher gas price but that would costs more. 2. If your transaction is successful but you still don't see the battle history, it's because the rank or the level of the opponent that you are trying to challenge has changed. To be fair, we need to ensure that the level and rank of your opponent are the same as the moment you submit the challenge. Q2. Can I sell my hog ? Your hog is an ERC-721 token based on Ethereum network. You can always sell it in the marketplace according to your price. We charge a 3.75% commission on the sold price. Q3. Is the game fair? The whole Hog Smash game is a smart contract running on Ethereum. The game rules are all coded in the smart contract together with your ERC-721 tokens so everyone is playing according to the same rule book. Q4. Can I use my flexi gems when someone else challenges me? No. Flexi gems can only be used when you take the initiative to challenge others. The advantage of flexi gems as the name implies is the flexibility you get in assigning the gems accordingly to your opponent's stats. This flexibility comes with a drawback, that is you can't use it when challenged. Q5. Why does some hog have different frame colors and icons on the top left corner? Those are special hogs with a little bonus given to them. For every 5 levels, they will be automatically given one increase on the attribute specified by the icon.

		"input": "king of eth. Auctions Exchange Realty In a land before UNIX time, in a contract far far away, when God created the board, the game was a formless void and darkness covered its face. Then God said, 'Let there be King of Eth;' and there was King of Eth. And God saw that the Game was good; and God decided to create two special titles for the players of his domain. 'The King,' God said, 'shall be the player who has contributed most to the housing in my society. Blessed is the man who builds a strong house, while lost is one who builds many poor houses too weak to quarter his brothers.' 'The Wayfarer,' God said, 'Shall be the player who has contributed most to the expansion of my most holy domain.' And God saw that these titles were good; and God decided to allow his subjects to expand into new parts of the board. 'I love you guys,' God said, 'but I love the King and the Wayfarer more.' So God let the King, Wayfarer, and then any normal pleb increase the board in that order. Some forward-thinking plebs eventually got fed up with the monarchy and decided to overthrow the King. This special group decided to call themselves the Parliament and to allow oversight of their rule by the plebs. Unfortunately, they weren't powerful enough to remove him (they are still plebs after all); the King still overthrows the Parliament every now and then... So, lowly pleb, are you just going to take it?

When you stake kBASEv0 into pool 203, it will be automatically converted to nkB (norm-kBASEv0), which is 'the amount of kBASEv0 you will have if the total supply of kBASEv0 is 1M', and hence unaffected by rebases. And the amount of nkB is different from the amount of kBASEv0, because the total supply of kBASEv0 is different from 1M. When you unstake nkB, it will be automatically converted back to kBASEv0. An example: [assume kB total supply = 3M] => [you deposit 3000 kB, and becomes 1000 nkB] => [kB rebased to 4M total supply, and nkB is unaffected] => [however if you unstake 1000 nkB now, it becomes 4000 kB]. Hence your kB is rebased correctly. [kBASEv0 REBASE (can call between XX:00:00 ~ XX:02:59 every hour)] [kBASEv0 contract] [kBASEv0 chart] [DEX contract] [DEX chart] FAQ: Note KF is not a yield farming project. The pools are for distributing tokens for AlphaDex & KittenSwap. You can download MetaMask app to use Kitten.finance on mobile devices. You are still earning Uniswap LP fees (0.30%) when staking your LP in KF pools. Because your LP shares appreciate over time (Uniswap collects fees for you). The first deposit to a pool needs an 'approval' tx. Wait for it to confirm, then refresh the page to stake to the pool. You can directly trade KIF using WETH, or provide KIF+WETH liquidity on UniSwap. This actually saves gas. So there's no need to unwrap WETH. Remember to leave some ETH for paying gas. NEVER set a high 'slippage tolerance %' when trading on Uniswap, or bots will frontrun you. Better use 0.2% slippage and high gas, and split large buy orders into multiple smaller orders. Click the top-right button in Uniswap to set slippage. That 0.x% is the extra slippage that can occur if someone frontruns you. So if you set the slippage tolerance too high, bots will be happy to do that. Safety Advices: Buy a Macbook (or air) or Chromebook. Erase the HD. Install nothing except Chrome & Metamask. Generate new addresses. Use it only for Kitten.Finance & MetaMask. There shall never be another 'approval' tx after you approved a pool for the first time. Otherwise it means the frontend is hacked or modified, and you are staking to the hacker's contract. For extra safety, use a Ledger for MetaMask.

We want to support Light Trail Rush for a long time with new content, seasonal events and esports competitions, no matter whether it's labelled as early access or the time after.” ？ “The full version of Light Trail Rush will have more options for social and professional competition. In addition we want to leverage blockchain technology to bring you an even better experience. In the end we would love Light Trail Rush to be for space brawling what Rocket League has been for motorized football.” ？ “Our current version of Light Trail Rush is already feature rich and fully playable. Our blockchain integration still needs to be finalized. As a game, this already is a fully functional game. But, like we said, we want to build on this by adding more features, options and modes.” ，？ “We are considering to increase the price of the over time, or when it gets its full release.

That means you can sell them, trade them, or just keep them forever. Join the Light Rail competition, brawl for honour, and earn eternal glory! Welcome to Light Trail Rush! In a far future, the galaxy is looking at the Light Trail competitions with excitement. This is where heroes are made and champions write history. In this action-packed brawler, it's not about reaching a finish line. Through fast-paced gameplay and tactical use of power-ups, eight competitors need to battle each other for points. Secure the most points and you will claim victory. The leader of the pack is called the Tracer. He's the one drawing the road, free-roaming through the battle arena in space. By making the road treacherous, those chasing him will fall off. This will earn the Tracer points. At the same time, the Chasers are fighting each other in an effort to claim the first spot. By using all kinds of power-ups, Chasers can earn points by bumping each other off the road. He who reaches the point limit first is victorious. Light Trail Rush guarantees action-packed and fast-paced gameplay. Now lets brawl! Features Unique action-packed, fast-paced gameplay Players draw the road themselves Free-roaming through different battle arenas Each map procedurally generated, no race is the same Online multiplayer for eight players Full controller support Four unique space ships, each with different attributes Unlockable customization options Unique skins, player-owned, stored on the Ethereum blockchain Story After centuries of space expansion, Ambrosium became the most coveted resource in the galaxy, the cause of conflict. When the Pax Ambrosia Treaty ended the war, the defeated and battered Houses were forced to surrender all Ambrosium trade rights to the Konsortium. Even though the treaty brought peace, the unfair distribution of resources and power resulted in a growing underground rebellion against the Konsortium. The Konsortium uses the Light Trail competitions as a peacekeeping endeavour to appease the masses. Millions attend Light Trail competitions, and the sport is a popular form of entertainment as well as a political outlet. Heroes of the Light Trail League bring hope and pride to the working class. : : Windows 7, 8.1, 10 (64Bit required) : Intel Core i5-4460, AMD FX -6300, or better : 4 GB RAM : NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD Radeon R7 260x wwith 2GB Video RAM, or better DirectX : 10 : : 3 GB : Xinput support Controllers recommended- Internet connection required for game activation and login.

Development with no-code is on thrives on building a community of citizen developers who create apps even if they have no coding skills. According to the global survey, almost 70% of businesses are shifting their business processes to low-code solutions. It means that you need to write a code line when planning an app building. Before the penetration of no-code development platforms to build apps, professional developers spent considerable time writing code for enterprise-grade applications. It was the time when creating these apps required extensive programming and time. At that time, app development process without programming knowledge was not possible. In recent years, these no-code platforms have replaced the traditional development process. Due to these rapid changes, professional developers have started depending on these tools, as they allow them to execute their business tasks without much hassle and spend time on more critical tasks. People usually think app building is always laborious, time-consuming, exhausting, and needs the coding skills of professional developers until the arrival of these development platforms. These solutions promise to simplify and accelerate the business processes with visual tools. Moreover, these low-code platforms offer the essential tools to automate the workflow of businesses. Do you want to create apps without hiring professional developers with extensive programming knowledge? If yes, look no further! In this article, we'll unveil the benefits of visual development, the difference between these two development solutions, and interesting facts about the development with no-code or less code. Let's dig deeper into the details. Is Low-Code No-Code the Future of Software Development? Low-code/no-code platforms are the future of website app development or mobile development due to the variety of drag and drop options. Application developers are going to rely more on these automated tools to provide affordable business solutions. However, a beginner can also carry out the programming process without seeking help from professional developers after the penetration of this quick development. Due to the affordability and rapid application development, the next era is the era of low-code development. Also, the demand for no-code development platforms massively increased during the pandemic when businesses shifted their operations to the digital world. The reason behind the massive use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based tools was the availability of a simple-to-use user interface that allowed the application development within a few clicks. At a time, creating business apps required hiring a developer's team with extensive coding knowledge. Keeping data in a central place was a complex process to automate the workflow of businesses. But thanks to no-code development solutions that help application developers to create applications without wasting time and needing much expertise in the development of business solutions. These development solutions are something where technology and application design go hand in hand to make your business app more interactive and give a new realm of low-code/no-code experience. The world is fastly adopting the era of low-code, a new beginning, and shortly, there will be a stage where traditional development will be a part of history. With the availability of low-code/no-code tools, application development has drastically shifted towards another era. Why Adopt No-Code/Low-Code Development? According to a Gartner survey, 65% of application development will be done with a low-code platform by 2025. Moreover, the idea of promoting the concept of 'Citizen Developers' has made this technology more popular. There are several reasons for the adoption of low-cod/ no-code application development to create interactive apps, which are as follows: Cloud Technology Has Made Everything Accessible There were days when only large businesses could develop applications by purchasing hardware until the arrival of these tools. But no-code/low-code tools such as AppMaster, SeaTable, Mendix, and OutSystems have made it possible to develop cloud apps to meet business needs. Before the penetration of low-code platforms, small businesses suffered severely as they could not purchase hardware due to a lack of funds. However, software development in cloud technology such as Searchable, Mendix, OutSystems, AppMaster, etc., has made things easy for all types of businesses. Try AppMaster no-code today!

SuperCountries is a simple game where players conquer the world by trading virtual countries using a cryptocurrency called Ether. Like in some other games, you can make a profit by selling your countries. But what sets SuperCountries apart is that you automatically qualify for lifetime Ether as soon as you enter the game! Once you've purchased a country, you'll receive dividends, bonuses, and regular jackpots for life. There are currently 6 ways to earn Ether, with 11 new ways coming soon. For more details, please see our FAQs. This impressive mechanic is governed automatically by a smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. Play How to play? Configuration: to play SuperCountries, you will need to install the MetaMask Browser Extension for your browser. This will allow you to execute in-browser purchases using Ether, the Ethereum Network cryptocurrency. Next, you will need to purchase Ether and transfer it to your MetaMask crypto wallet. A popular place to purchase Ether (instantly) is at Coinbase.com. See our FAQs for more details. Gameplay: get rewards by conquering countries on the map. As told above, every player will get lifetime rewards. To become a player, all you need is to buy (or have bought) at least one country (won countries don't count). No matter the price, no matter if you sell it right after. So first, pick a country in the marketplace to be immediately qualified for eternal dividends and rewards. Got your first country? After every buy, the price automatically increases. If someone else wants to conquer the same country, they can take it away from you by paying up to double the price that you paid. You will then lose the ownership of that country, but you will receive your profit in Ether automatically transferred back to your crypto wallet. From now, you are also qualified for lifetime rewards, even if you sell all your countries. You will get dividends proportionally to your current and past purchases, get bonuses when inviting friends and maybe win the regular jackpot. And of course, the more you play, the higher your rewards. Read our FAQs to learn how to increase your rewards. Fun advertising: this game is mostly made to have fun and dominate the world with your color and your name. Use the game as an advertising space for your brand, website, youtube channel or referral links. If you own a country, you own an advertising space and a color. Your nickname, which you can modify, appears on it and if your nickname contains an url, people can click on it. Your nickname (and color) is displayed multiple times : on the map, on the list of countries and for some players on the leaderboard of the top 10 current owners and all dashboards. Play Super Friendly Value increase SuperCountries has a value increase model that's friendly to players, with some of the lowest commissions in the industry. Unlike other collectible games that take large commissions on each purchase, SuperCountries puts its players first. Our open-sourced Smart Contract is available for anyone to review. Level Price range (ETH) Price increase Dev Cut Level 1 0.01 - 0.04 100% 5% Level 2 0.04 - 0.6 60% 4% Level 3 0.6 - 2.5 48% 3% Level 4 2.5 - 7 36% 3% Level 5 7+ 24% 2% Super Friendly Rewards When a country is bought, the net profit is distributed as follows: 65% goes to the seller, and the remaining amount is distributed among all players according to the table. If a player falls into more than one category, the rewards are added up!

Our awesome feature (lifetime dividends for each buyer) is available at launch. Each player who buys at least one NFT country will earn Ether dividends for each new transaction occurring in the game. Phase #2 Summer 2018 Unlock & contests After the launch, we'll control the first settings, listen to your feedbacks and gradually unlock all NFT countries. Since the supply is limited, all countries should be unlocked before the end of summer and become more and more valuable. There will be regular contests to win the newly and last unlocked NFT countries, ETH rewards and Trophy Cards (useful on Phase #3). Phase #3 Q4 2018 SUPERCOUNTRIES WAR GAME - First additional game SuperCountries Phase #1 was just the beginning, discover the additional game WAR and fight your countries!

Use MUSE to buy different gems and raise in the leaderboard, the higher you are in the leaderboard the more MUSE you'll mine daily. Careful though, if you don't buy gems for several days your vNFT will die and get burned and won't be able to mine any more MUSE.
