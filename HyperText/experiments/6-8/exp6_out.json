It is an incredibly lucrative  staking DApp that is built on the shoulders of giants. Drawing  inspiration from the highly successful T2X platform from the  glory days of DeFi; Avarice brings the auction fun and FOMO to  the Binance Smart Chain. Avarice is designed to provide maximum benefit to the stakers.  Users will buy AVC tokens with BNB on our easy to use dApp.  They can then stake their tokens to earn interest paid in AVC  along with their share of the BNB dividends from the daily  01 02 auction lobby. Users can make as many stakes they want for as  03 long as they want up to a maximum of 300 days. The longer the  04 stake, the more interest you earn, all while enjoying staking  05 bonuses along the way. Simple. How do you get AVC Tokens? There are 3 main ways that you can get AVC tokens: 1. Participate in a daily auction and swap your BNB for  AVC tokens. 2. Refer your friends and earn 5% bonus on all of their  auction entries. 01 02 3. Stake AVC to earn daily interest on your stake. (See  03 04 \u201ctokenomics\u201d for a full breakdown) 05 Staking System The staking portal lives on our panel  where users can stake their AVC  tokens for their desired duration up to  300 days. stakes will accrue daily BNB  dividends based on the amount of  AVC tokens staked, This amount will  vary on the amount of BNB in the  lobby on each day of the stake, stakes  will also receive AVC bonus tokens. 01 02 Users will be able to collect their  03 staked tokens and the dividends at  04 the end of their stakes period.  05 Bonus Tokens Users receive bonus AVC tokens on their active stakes which is  highly based on the duration of their stakes.  Longer the duration higher the bonus percentage. The graph shows the growth  of the bonus tokens % for  01 Stakes, At its highest (which  02 is 300 days) the percentage  03 goes up to 105%.  04 05 What is the Dividends pool? 94% of all BNB that enters the daily auction lobby is pooled to be  distributed back out to the stakers, which we call the dividends  pool.  At the end of each day the BNB dividend pool will be  calculated and allocated to all of the open stakes based on their  staked amount. How is the Dividends pool calculated? As shown on the next slide daily dividend payout is split over a period of  time. For example, assuming day 3 ended with a 100 Lobby BNB entry,  that BNB will be divided by 3 as it's day 3, and split out over 3 days in  chunks of 33.3 BNB. Another example; day 10 ends with 100 BNB, these  06 BNB are split into chunks of 10 which are sent out over 10 days. As the  07 days go on and the pools grow in size, these dividends will keep going  08 and adding allowing for much stronger and stable payouts! This caps at  09 day 60. This also ensures that our project can live a longer lifespan and  10 adds to the game theory behind the staking of the tokens themselves.   Auctions! Auction lobbies are the main way users can acquire AVC,  Each day AVC tokens will be auctioned and users can pledge  BNB and collect AVC tokens at the end of the day proportional to  their contribution. Where does all the BNB go? How many tokens? 94% of all BNB collected is returned On day 1 Lobby there will be  to the stakers. The other 6% is 3,000,000 tokens up for grabs. At the  reserved for development costs and end of every day the amount of  buybacks which will be explained in tokens in the auction pool will  06 the next slide. decrease by 0.5%. 07 08 The 'price' of the token will depend on how much BNB has been contributed to  09 the lobby on that day. If you watch closely you will be able to spot light days and  10 take advantage by increasing your share of that day's pool. Buybacks! The 6% that the team collects will be used to facilitate marketing, team costs but  more importantly buybacks. The 1% buybacks will be used to foster and cultivate  continual growth of the platform over the long term. Using the teams discretion,  then the 1% will regularly be put back into the system to add to the dividends  pool. These tokens will also be burned to add an extra layer of benefit to the  community. Selling & Buying stakes There is no direct feature in contract to sell AVC Tokens, however there is a  feature for users to sell their active stakes! In the panel on the \u201cbuy & sell\u201d section  users can put up their stakes for sell or chose to buy other users auctioned  stakes!  06 Buying an active stake will move the stake to the buyers account and it will be  07 visible in their panel and collectable (both the stakes AVC tokens and its BNB  08 dividends) after the stake ended. 09 10 There is a 10% fee that the stakes seller pays, which 8% of that will be buybacked to the contracts current day lobby. Referral System Avarice has a great referral system that rewards both side!  everyone wins when using a ref link! There's zero reason  NOT to use one! Your referrals will earn an extra 1% minted AVC tokens on  their auction lobby collect, As the referrer you will earn an  extra 5%.

More and more free messaging apps are  being released however, contrary to popular belief, these apps are not  truly free. Many messaging companies are earning money hand over fist  by selling your data to advertisers.  In addition, these messaging apps have become targets for cyber-attacks leaving personal information of users exposed by these  massive data hacks.  In todays day and age where privacy and control have become an online  farce, PunkPanda seeks to bring back what should be an absolute right - privacy and freedom of communication. The world has been  tricked and conditioned into believing that privacy isnt a right. This lack  of privacy, security, and trust in current online platforms has left people  unprotected and feeling vulnerable. Even worse, feeling financially and  morally exploited. PunkPanda has launched several products that cater to the different  messaging needs of different users. Currently, PunkPanda has six products in its ecosystem - PandaApp, PandaPlay, PandaMeet, PandaProfit, PandaVault, and PandaPost. These apps and web-based  systems allow users to text, make video calls, play games, and share files  without hassle or concern. Through its vast app pool, PunkPanda aims to create an ecosystem where  people can communicate safely and securely. PAGE | 03 PUNKPANDA THE PRIVACY PROBLEM  WITH MOBILE MESSAGING APPS The Privacy Problem with Mobile Messaging Apps We all depend on electronic communication every day. We use it to send  files, hold conversations and communicate information that shapes our  lives and business. But have you ever thought about who else is listening  to your conversations? How many times have you talked about something and then started  seeing ads for it? Who else has access to your messages, conversations &  images? Is your data truly safe?  Even though the messaging industry is generating tens of billions of  dollars every year, it has faced numerous challenges over the years, as  illustrated below:     Half a million Zoom user accounts were compromised and sold on a     dark web forum in April 2020.                  Data breaches exposed 36 billion records in the first half of 2020.     In one of the biggest breaches of all time, 3 billion Yahoo accounts were     hacked.             Smaller organizations (1250 employees) have the highest targeted     malicious email rate at 1 in 323.       Since the pandemic began, the FBI reported a 300% increase in     cybercrimes.  With cyber-attacks rising and privacy exploitation exploding today,  theres a desperate need to communicate information online in a simple  and familiar way - yet in a way thats more private and secure.

PAGE | 10 PUNKPANDA 2.4 PunkPanda Token The PunkPanda token acts as a share of ownership for the app community and all revenue streams that exist within the protocol. The  token has a portion reserved for staking rewards in the early period to  encourage holding versus selling, as well as various upgrades inside of  the system, such as access to encrypted File Sharing, Video Conferencing,  and Storage Vault. In addition, the token can also be used as a currency in  the upcoming PunkPanda game, where unlimited amounts of NFTs will  be traded and sold. An example of this would be a user who would like to sell a badge theyve  earned in the game. The user can make a lucrative offer in the app marketplace and sell their badges to the party that accepts the offer. The  exchange of tokens will take place within the gaming platform. A small  portion of the token swap will be restored in the PunkPanda staking pool,  which would generate an ongoing revenue stream by incentivizing the  tokens in the long run.  Gamers can also choose to exchange their PunkPanda token with a  popular token (such as ETH) within our in-app liquidity pool. PunkPanda  token holders who wish to exit from their position can opt-out once the  exchange process is completed.  In short, we will create quite a bit of utility and value for the token to the  point where our users would want to hold it and therefore drive the price  higher through the normal laws of supply and demand. 2.5 Security and Encryption PunkPanda End-to-end encryption End-to-End encryption (E2EE) is a trusted method of secure communication that prevents any third parties from accessing data  while its transferred from one end device to another or system. In  PAGE | 11 PUNKPANDA end-to-end encryption, the encryption occurs at the device level. In laymans terms, files and messages are encrypted before they leave the  smartphone or computer and arent decrypted before they reach their  final destination. As a result, hackers cannot access the data on the  server because they do not have the private keys to decrypt the data.  Instead, secret keys are stored with the user on their smartphone or  computer, which makes it harder to access a users data.  In PunkPanda, the data is encrypted on the sender's mobile phone, and  only the intended recipient can decrypt it. This means, as the text message travels to its destination in a fraction of a second, it cannot be  read or tampered with by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), hacker, application service provider, or any other entity or service. The secure  \u201cPanda tunnel\u201d ensures that only the intended recipient can read your  content so you can relax, knowing that your privacy is assured. Our  encryption technology makes it impossible for any \u201cmiddleman attacks\u201d  or even PunkPanda to share user information since we do not have it. Our end-to-end encryption mechanism uses public-key cryptography  that stores private keys on the endpoint devices. Our Panda Public key  can be shared with others, similar to a cryptocurrency public (receive)  address. Once shared, other PunkPanda users can generate a message  and send it to the public key owner. Furthermore, the message can only  be decrypted using the corresponding private key, also known as the  decryption key. This means, only those people who have access to the  decryption key or endpoint devices would be able to read the message. This peer-to-peer technology sets PunkPanda apart in the world of  end-to-end encryption. PunkPanda also has open-source encryption  technology so that any user can verify our word on how your privacy and  data is handled.

PAGE | 17 PUNKPANDA TOKEN SALE In todays digital age, cryptocurrency has become immensely popular  among Internet users and businesses alike. The PunkPanda Token will  represent a major step forward in the adoption of cryptocurrency worldwide. In the future, the following plan may be considered as one of the most  successful launches of a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Token. This plan will  be known as the \u201cIncubator Plan\u201d. The Incubators 3 stage Plan has many advantages over most of, if not, all  methods to launch a token, which are discussed below:     Allows us to grow a very loyal audience.     Validates formulas & ideas before the actual smart contract is     deployed.     Reduced start-up costs.     An ongoing private sale that will continue 24/7.     Makes for better platform sales  Example: ITC Global; Super One All this combined will lead to a better pre-sale, public sale & public launch.  The presale will provide the liquidity required for launching on a DEX. 3.1 Token Overview Total Supply:      275,000,000  Ticker Symbol:  PPM Pre-mine:             65,000,000      25M Incubator (Token Pre-sale, Marketing, Airdrops, Promotions,      PandaPal Sharing Rewards)     32M Founders, Advisors, Executive Team      8M Primary Investment Partners  PAGE | 18 PUNKPANDA 3.2 Token Private Sale & Pre-Sale Start Date: Oct 26th, 2021 Target Date for Completion: Dec 15th, 2021 Intent: Scale PunkPanda Token (PPM) from 0.10 Cents to 1.00 USD All tokens will be auto-staked & earning interest during this phase,  including Panda Pals.

During or upon the completion of the pre-sale, we will deploy the smart  contract. Members & Panda Pals can only withdraw their interest earned in Phase 1. To ensure withdrawals are liquidated for the members, BNB (Binance Token) will be preferred.  Starting on the first day to promote the PandaApp & Panda Pals Program,  all members will receive a portion of a Panda Token within 30 minutes of  download.     PAGE | 19 PUNKPANDA PunkPanda Private & Presale Rules 1.  Tokens Available - 10M Tokens will be available for sale (Private Sale      will only be for 3-5 days, then the presale will start.

However, you can withdraw the daily interest we pay anytime      you would like. Please see the minimum withdrawal that you will be      allowed each month after we list. If you want to withdraw any of the      daily interest you are earning, we will convert your PunkPanda token to      BNB.

PunkPanda Token is a Mined Token - The Smart Contract will deliver a      new block of 2100 PunkPanda tokens every 30 minutes for the first      year. In the second year, the smart contract will deliver a new block of      1050 PunkPanda tokens every 20 minutes for the year. In the 4th year,      smart contract will deliver 525 PunkPanda tokens every 15 minutes. In      the 8th year, 263 PunkPanda tokens will be delivered every 8 minutes.      This will help to make the PunkPanda token difficult to mine and more      valuable. PAGE | 20 PUNKPANDA There are 3 categories of our members that receive these rewards.      Panda Pals  Members that have referred the PunkPanda app to others by using a unique code. No need to sell or buy anything; simply share the referral code and win fresh PPM tokens every 30 minutes.  Panda Token Holders \u201cApp\u201d  Members that hold their tokens in our Digital Wallet that is inside the PunkPanda App.  Panda Token Holders \u201cFarm\u201d  External Wallets can participate in rewards through PunkPanda Farms.  The smart contract will be delivering the rewards of the newly minted  PunkPanda Tokens every 30 minutes to the following four categories: PANDA PALS who hold their tokens in our Punk Panda \u201capp\u201d digital wallet  are DOUBLE DIPPING every 30 minutes!     1050 will be distributed to Panda Pals      485 will be distributed to Panda Token Holders \u201cApp\u201d Digital Wallet     inside the app     250 will be distributed to Panda Token Holders \u201cFarm\u201d     315 will be distributed to \u201cMarketing\u201d The formula for Panda Token Holders \u201cApp\u201d is simply determined by how  many tokens you hold in your wallet multiplied by the block reward / total  supply of tokens in the Punk Panda App. The mining rewards for the Panda token can be calculated by the following formula. P = The number of Panda Tokens held in the \u201cApp\u201d R = The Block Reward         S = Supply in circulation only in PunkPanda App  Formula = (P*R) / S PAGE | 21 PUNKPANDA Note: The circulating supply changes approximately every 30 minutes  because of the mining reward generated.  The Panda Token Holders \u201cFarm\u201d would be a more experienced crypto  investor. They are the ones to buy tokens at Pancake Swap & earn  rewards. Simply by moving them to the PunkPanda Farm,  the rewards of PunkPanda Tokens will come every 30 minutes. All PunkPanda token  holders will see the number of PunkPanda tokens growing in their wallets. P = The number of PunkPanda tokens held at the PunkPanda Farm R = The Block Reward S = Supply in circulation at the PunkPanda Farm Formula = (P*R) / S 6. Panda \u201cFarm\u201d Interest Payments will be swapped for smart contract      When the presale ends, there is a transition period for a couple of      days. Once the presale ends, you will be paid interest on your staked      tokens (all that were purchased in presale) for a period of 8 to 15 days.      We will announce the exact days at the end of the sale. During this      time, the smart contract will deploy and start delivering PunkPanda      tokens every 30 minutes to your wallet. You will be able to withdraw      these tokens anytime you want, just like your interest payments. 7.  A Very Special 48 Hour Rule- PunkPanda Token Holders \u201capp\u201d & Panda      Token Holders \u201cFarm\u201d automatically stake the tokens in the wallets.  A      smart contract connects with the staked wallets.  If you un-stake your      wallet to withdraw, you will not receive rewards (every 30 minutes) for      the next 48 hours.  Smart Contract will skip the delivery of that wallet      for 48 hours. When you unstake it will take 48 hours to withdraw. Make      sure you do your withdrawal, then stake the remaining tokens and the      Smart Contract will start delivering again. PAGE | 22 PUNKPANDA 8.

Exchange Listing Q1 2022 (Goal is January) Aiming to list at $1 USD or       more on Pancake Exchange .     PAGE | 23 PUNKPANDA 3.3. Token Mining Mining:  PunkPanda Token (PPM) is a minable token. The mining rewards holders  receive depend upon factors including:     the number of times the PunkPanda app has been used,     the number of tokens they are holding, and     the number of people they have shared the app with (PandaPals). The mining reward is directly proportional to blocks generated on the  BSC, Binance Smart Chain. Mining tokens with PunkPanda is quite easy  and hassle-free. Unlike Bitcoin mining where highly expensive hardware  miners and energy costs are used to mine the tokens, PunkPanda uses  proof of stake. For proof of stake and proof of PandaPals, you just need  to use the App on your mobile phone, hold tokens in your wallet, and your  PunkPanda token mining rewards will automatically appear in your digital wallet. The mining schedule will be done via a smart contract and will govern the  token allocation of each mining block over the entire 15-year mining  schedule. This provides assurance that the token rewards program  outlined at the beginning of the project, not only is executed fairly and  flawlessly but remains in place in perpetuity.  Each PunkPanda token mining phase has a halving interval after which  the block reward will decrease and the time per block will also decrease.  There are four phases of mining:   Phase 1: The first phase begins at the time of deployment of the smart  contract.  Mining intervals in this phase span 30 minutes where 2100  PunkPanda tokens are allocated per block.  PAGE | 24 PUNKPANDA Phase 2: This phase consists of two years. The reward will be 50% of the  reward in phase 1. Therefore, mining intervals in this phase span 2",

They are the symbol of victory and strength. Powerful and tough.and our $BNBTIGER community is the same. $BNBTIGER is a decentralized experiment, launched on the January 3, 2022, by the founder, BNBTiger9527, as a fresh opportunity for those who were struggling in the midst of the biggest bear market since. Born out of trials and tribulation, the $BNBTIGER community is the strongest community you'll find, supportive of one another, and pushing each other towards success. We are fed up with the fraud projects in the market! These projects have lowered people's trust, led to suspicion and panic, and finally led to the death of one project after another. No more great projects like Shib can be born! The goal of the birth of BNBTiger is to rebuild the security and trust of the market. Like Shib, Let's complete another 260000 X the task. So we launched a huge number of 10.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 tokens, destroyed 50%, and launched fairly! Let's start from zero. This is a new social experiment. We want to see how many zeros can be killed by real trust! Our ultimate goal is to eliminate all zeros and surpass the historical record of shib! #BNBTIGER-Fierce.Firm.Victory BNBTiger Contract: 0xac68931b666e086e9de380cfdb0fb5704a35dc2d BNBTiger NFTs Buy on Opensea Buy on Bitkeep Total Security Liq Burn: 74.3710% Liq Locked:: 24.4021% Tax Allocation Token Allocation Tax 9 % Tax 2 % Backflow 2 % Buyback 2 % Marketing 3 % Philanthropy Buy Now Token Total Supply: 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Burn Supply: 5,613,347,139,019,740,000,000,000 Max Supply: 4,386,652,860,980,260,000,000,000 Circulating Supply: 4,386,652,860,980,260,000,000,000 Buy Now Burn And Donation Dear #BNBTIGER Army : We have completed 19 burns and 5 donations so far.
