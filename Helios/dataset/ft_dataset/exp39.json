We are currently working on raising a larger fund to make equity investments.Submit Starting a DAO to buy and tokenize land in Wyoming, who wants in? Scott Fitsimones FAQ Frequently Asked Questions CityDAO is exploring decentralized asset ownership on chain, starting with a piece of land in Wyoming. Each parcel of land is an NFT that can be governed collectively by the DAO. CityDAO is growing with a global pool of talents, working to create web3 solutions for DAO governance, affordable housing, city building, and more. Why put land on the blockchain? Digitizing physical assets democratizes access, increases transparency, removes gatekeepers, and reduces complexity. Putting land on chain has several benefits:Instant land transfers, reduced legal complexity and democratization of ownership through crowdfunding. Currently land is only available to large investors who can afford an entire parcel. Why Wyoming? Our hope is that CityDAO is able to buy land all over the US and world. We are starting in Wyoming because of the state's new 2021 DAO law, which recognizes DAO governance of LLC corporations. Because LLCs can own land, this creates a powerful pathway for decentralized land ownership. What will the land be used for? You! As part of the DAO, you can help vote and execute on what happens with the land. Who decides what the land is used for? Parcel0 NFT holders will collectively vote to decide on what Parcel0 will be used for. How do I get involved Stay in touch on twitter @CityDAO, and join the Discord!

This latin saying means that life is short and that you should enjoy it to the fullest. It is often symbolized by a skull. And this is how Mories were born. The Mories are 10k little skeleton dudes living on the blockchain to remind us of this on the metaverse. The Mories are kind, inclusive and creative. Getting yourself a Morie gives you access to a community of dreamers, thinkers, lovers, peaceful revolutionaries that believes in education and growth by sharing and having fun. Being a morie But being a Morie is more than that. It is experimenting one of the most amazing technological revolution in a safe, and careful environment. We have always made your happiness our priority. We dream of a society where everybody would have time to focus on who they are, to grow, evolve, discover their passions, and feel happy and accomplished. And we believe that this is something we can achieve with this project and the NFT technology. Making a living is complicated, draining, and time consuming. It is often what forbids people to follow their dreams. We are building this project with the idea of providing our collectors a daily income. We believe that we will achieve this in the coming months with the creative tokenomics strategy we are building, the games, and real-life utility. We have worked hard to assure the Morie community was as inclusive, kind and caring as possible. The FaMorie became a place where people felt safe to share their fears and traumas. By embracing this movement, we quickly became known in the space as advocates of the mental health cause. We thought about giving a percentage of our royalties to charity, but we believed we could do better. We promised we would always try to be innovative and push the boundaries in everything we do. And we hope to have achieved this today. The CryptoMorie team is extremely happy and proud to announce that we have partnered with Impact Suite to provide free, individualized professional mental health support to owners of the Mories, as well as their immediate relatives. This includes unlimited teletherapy, coaching, well being tracking, and many other amazing things that we hope will help the Mories and their close ones on their quest to achieve hapiness and well being. Rebranding What start as a fun PFP project became a brand. Faster than we could have ever imagined. We are now rebranding accordingly. To give more power to our community.

A commodity that is 'fungible' is something that can be exchanged for the same value, and is completely interchangeable. The most common example of this is money.For instance, $20 bills are fungible - they can be swapped for another $20 and you wouldn't notice the difference, or you could swap them for 2 x $10. Whichever way you exchange them, it makes no difference - the value is the same, meaning you essentially have the same commodity. You still have $20, regardless of how you try to cut it. So, something that is non fungible is something which cannot be exchanged or interchanged with anything of the same value - as there is nothing exactly like it. In this sense, a non-fungible commodity can be assigned value and bought, but as it is completely unique, it is non interchangeable for anything else like itself. We use NFT's to represent Digital Collectibles, they are not investments or a means to make money. How do I buy one? NFTs are commonly traded on marketplaces such as Opensea.io or aggregators of marketplaces like Gem.xyz DeadHeads NFTs can be found using the Official Links in Discord.gg/DeadHeads. We recommend one of the following: https://opensea.io/collection/deadheads https://opensea.io/collection/haloheads-nft https://opensea.io/collection/deadheads-skull-troopers How much does it cost? The price of an NFT will vary depending on what people decide to price them at, each individual one will have a unique price. Do I need to buy a Deadhead to be a part of the community? Yes, or a Skull Trooper or a Halo Head. DeadHeads is a franchise containing many varying assets When is the next Episode? We strive to have a new episode ready every 2-3 weeks.

The combination of the minting interface & burning mechanism makes the community members the exclusive creators, curators & collectors of Eponyj.

Not all designs are the same. We must destroy, we must rebuild, we must improve. The community will decide which Eponyms will remain available and which Eponyms will become irrelevant. It is up to you to decide what Eponym will look like in the future. To allow this, we will introduce a swapping mechanism — letting you exchange two existing Eponyms for a new one. The new Eponyms will be listed in a different collection — Eponym Gen II. The exchanged Eponyms will be sent to a “graveyard” address — youll be able to see the exchanged art but it wont be tradable. This will create a constantly self-optimising collection. PERKS To add more value to owning an Eponym, owners of Eponyms can claim a 7K high definition file of their Eponym. Ownership of an Eponym come will full commercial rights - you are free to use it in any way you wish. We are amazed by this community and we want all of you to enjoy your art in many forms and present it however you wish — so watch out, physical art collectibles coming. Finally, stay tuned.

DeFi(Decentralized Finance) is constantly evolving. Most investors entering the DeFi space either , dont have the time to properly manage a portfolio of yield farming strategies or struggle to navigate all the steps , required to participate. Empire Capital provides an effective solution and removes the need for active management , by the user. Empire Capital is the easy button for DeFi investing. , Build, Cryptocurrency is ever-evolving, and the technology and use-case are advancing rapidly. Empire Capital looks to , capitalize on its innovative technology and other project ventures whose ideas could change the landscape as we , know it. Empire Capital is contracting out its developers to help build third-party projects by offering infrastructure , services. Empire Capital receives time-locked investments into ECC in return for developmental services. These ser-, vices benefit the Empire Capitals community and partners in addition to spreading awareness as a helping hand in , shaping the future of cryptocurrency. , Bridge, Empire Capital looks to bring forth a new era where all cryptocurrency and fiat are easily interchangeable and read-, ily available. Empire Capital believes its Rounding Up App - Roundify - will be a bridge from CeFi to DeFi and act as , a DeFi normalization stepping stone to the vision Empire Capital hopes to achieve. Roundify will allow investors entry , into ECC and other crypto-index funds without navigating the many steps it takes to participate as it is now. In addi-, tion, Roundify will be informative regarding innovative cryptocurrency projects on the market, and most importantly, it , will provide easy access for CeFi investors to DeFi Projects. Empire Capital is not only a FaaS DeFi project; it is a team , of builders and innovators diversifying yields within and well beyond DeFi. , Empire Capital is not only a FaaS DeFi project, it is a team of builders and innovators diversifying yields within and , beyond DeFi. The services offered is at a minimum three-fold; providing management of high yield DeFi assets for our , users, providing cross-chain infrastructure and developmental support for new cryptocurrency innovators looking to , implement products within the DeFi space, and pioneering the seamless connection between everyday CeFi investors , and the DeFi ecosystem., Mission, Since our inception, our mission has been to simplify investing and building Decentralized Finance projects while , making it universally accessible and beneficial. Today, people turn to Empire Capital for peace of mind when look-, ing for developmental support or to invest. We are grateful to offer such services. As the cryptocurrency landscape , continues to advance, we will stay adaptive and committed to maintaininvg an exceptional level of support., , 2.01 Tokenomics , On each purchase of ECC, there is a 10% fee. 9% of the buy fee is distributed amongst the existing , holders according to their ECC amount. 1% is removed from existence, as Empire Capitals burn , mechanism results in a proper burn. The vast majority of “tax tokens” offer a burn function in their con-, tract, which sends “burned” tokens to a “dead-wallet” or “black-hole wallet” as their deflation meth-, od. These burn methods do not affect the total supply, and the burn wallets end up stealing yield/, reflections from actual holders. By implementing a true 1% burn on every buy, ECCs total supply , will constantly deflate while your balance continuously increases against an ever-deflating supply. , These tokenomics create a proper supply-and-demand metric for ECC as it becomes increasingly , scarce with volume., Holders, New Buyer 1% Burn 9% Reflection, Buy, 10% , Defi 3.0 yield, Sell 2% Auto-LP 4% Treasury 4% Marketing , 10% (Hold ECC, get a share of 0.05% of , EmpireDex fees that the ECC treasury own), Invest in other yield generating , assets as part of treasury , On each sell/transfer of $ECC, there is a 10% fee. 4% is allocated to the ECC treasury, where funds are issued , to invest or farm in projects to increase the value of the treasury portfolio. Moreover, Empire Capital may issue , treasury funds to purchase ECC tokens to be burned, thus raising the price floor while lowering the total supply. , In addition, 4% of each sell will be allocated to a marketing wallet for advertising across mainstream and social , media to spread awareness about Empire Capital and the services provided. Finally, 2% of each sell will be added , to liquidity, as it is essential and beneficial to the stability of ECC that a healthy amount of liquidity is maintained to , promote longevity and a less volatile chart. Greater liquidity enables larger purchases or sells of ECC, enabling , large-capital backers to invest in the token more effectively., Maximum Supply: 100,000,000 ECC, 10% Buy Fee, 9% of each buy goes to existing holders., 1% of each buy is burned from the supply forever., 10% Sell/Transfer fee, 4% of each sell goes into the treasury fund which will then go into multi-chain farming or to buyback ECC tokens., 4% of each sell goes into marketing ECC to bring more awareness into Empire Capital ecosystem., 2% of each sell goes into is used to create more liquidity (ECC/BNB LP)., Supply Supply decreases with Demand, Demand, We have implemented a true 1% burn on every buy so that our total supply will constantly be deflating around your , balance while your balance is constantly increasing against an ever-deflating supply. Creating a true supply/de-, mand metric to the ECC token as it becomes ever so scarce with volume., 2.03 Governance, Voting, ECC holders will be able to make proposals on strategies and vote on these proposals. 1 ECC will , equal to1 voting point.

Under the expertise of Michael Moran, Empire Capital , LTD will use treasury funds combined with angel funds to invest in CeFi(Centralized/Traditional Finance) startups, , private sales, IPOs, etc. , The vast majority of people in the world have not participated in cryptocurrencies. More often than not, this results , from the barriers presented to new investors when first entering the world of DeFi. Empire Capital aims to be the ac-, cess point for new users to enter the decentralized world. The main problem many hesitant investors face with cryp-, tocurrencies is the lack of accessibility.

The user configures the round-ups as the nearest , dollar, 5 dollars or 10 dollars, etc. In addition, there are other investment features such as one-off transactions within , pre-configured limits. For example, instead of buying cigarettes, a user can invest a one-off sum to see the benefits of , quitting a bad habit; and make Regular payments the day after payday, etc. The app will also include a dashboard , display of investments to track progress., The benefits of Roundify are ever-expanding for ECC, DeFi, and users alike.

It should be looked as a higher risk strategy where users grow there number of beans which can be sold for the native Currency which has been pooled. 0: can bean value go down yes. Beans are pegged to BNB, AVAX, or ETC so if there is less native Currency in the contract then the value will go down. 1: What happens when I bag jellybeans When you buy Beans, the Currency you used ( BNB, AVAX, or ETC ) gets locked into the jellybeanbag smart contract and rewards you with up to 8% in jellybeans daily returns every day. 2: Can I take my initial coins back? No. Bean vaule is dependent on the pools total value. when beans are sold the pools value goes down when bought they go up. When you buy 'miners' they are mining beans which if u can sell to let u get the respective value in the native chainCurrency or keep getting more beans. 3: How much are my fees? There is a small 3% dev fee in order to pay for developing the jellybeanbag ecosystem and buy backs 4: How often should I re-bag (compound)? Fell free to do so as often as you wish. but there are different strategies that exist. 5: How is jellybeanbag sustainable? jellybeanbag is sustained by continued community support, just as every other crypto coin, token or project.

General information Ticker: ALI Total supply: 100,000,000 ALI Contract Address on BSC: 0x557233E794d1a5FbCc6D26dca49147379ea5073c Chain: Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) 2. Distribution mechanics ALI has a low fixed max supply of 100 million tokens with a 5-year distribution plan. The amount allocated to the initial airdrop distribution is 5%, while 95% of the total supply is tightly scheduled in distribution activities across both the Alita.Finance ecosystem and its CEX partners trading platforms within five years. To avoid inflation, AlitaSwap's token distribution mechanism provides that 20% fewer ALI tokens enter circulation (emissions) every six months. At this early stage of development, the ALI allocation rates are balanced in a way that will encourage and incentivize users participation on both AlitaSwap and its CEX partners trading platforms. More particularly: 47,5% (47,5 million) of the total ALI supply are set aside as incentives for trading participants on numerous CEX partners trading platforms. Yield farmers on Alita are entitled to 23,75% of the total ALI supply while the remaining tokens (23,75%) will go toward rewarding staking participants. Important 1. We did not raise any funds from public investors for launching and developing Alita.Finance. However, the project itself still represents a community-driven DeFi ecosystem because its native ALI token was created as a means of giving back to our global trader community for their genuine and continuous support. As such, ALI tokens function solely as rewards for our investors and 100% of the total ALI supply will be distributed within 5 years with no single ALI reserved for the team behind it. 2. The ultimate goal of the Alita.Finance project is to shift investors from traditional finance to decentralized crypto marketplaces. In order for the project to achieve this long-term objective, the team has a strategic token distribution plan that aims to gradually increase the number of ALI distributed as rewards to various existing and upcoming investment options in the Alita.Finance ecosystem. We might also consider reducing the number of ALI tokens allocated to our CEX partners users over time. 3. Our token distribution strategy can be very flexible depending on the new user growth rate on Alita.Finance, the demand for ALI tokens across the CEX and DEX sectors, the future crypto market conditions as well as any major changes in the global DeFi landscape.

Similar to many fair launch projects, we will reward various participants that help bootstrap our ecosystem. This will be the only way to earn ALPACA tokens. What is the ALPACA token used for? Capture Economic Benefits of the Platform (Performance fee sharing and buyback & burn) We will let the community decide how they want the economic incentives to be captured by the ALPACA token; For example, it could be similar to Sushiswap where x% of fees generated go to perform token buyback and burn. At the moment though, there are already several mechanisms in place for both performance fee sharing and for making ALPACA deflationary in nature. 10% of the 19% performance fees for yield farming positions on the single-asset CAKE vault is distributed as Protocol APR to ALPACA governance vault depositors. 4% of the 5% of every liquidation bounty that any liquidation bot receives as a fee, goes towards weekly buybacks and burns of the ALPACA token. 6% of 19% of the AF1.0's lending interest that lenders earn is used for ALPACA buyback and distributed as revenue sharing to Governance Vault stakers (as Protocol APR) 4% of 19% of the AF1.0's lending interest that lenders earn goes towards buybacks and burns of the ALPACA token. Proceeds from occasional revenue generation events go to ALPACA buyback & burn, such as 20% of the revenue from the Alpies sales which summed to $1.25Mn. 2.5% of 5% royalty fees on Alpie NFTs sold in the secondary market go to ALPACA buyback & burn. 5% of 9% of Auto-Farming Performance Fee, which is from rewards earned from farming the collateralized assets in AUSD positions in Alpaca Staking (and potentially external protocols in the future), is used for buyback & burn. 1% of 2% of Stability Fee charged on each AUSD debt position will be used for buyback & burn. 5% of 9% of Farming Performance Fee, which is from yield farming rewards, is used for ALPACA buyback and distributed as performance fee sharing to Governance Vault stakers (as Protocol APR). 8% of 15% of AV Farming Performance Fee, which is from yield farming rewards in Automated Vaults, is used for ALPACA buyback and distributed as performance fee sharing to Governance Vault stakers (as Protocol APR). 1% of 2% of AV Management Fee, which is the management fee on Automated Vaults, goes towards weekly buybacks and burns of the ALPACA token. .1% of .2% of AV Withdrawal Fee, which is the fee when withdrawing from an Automated Vault, goes towards weekly buybacks and burns of the ALPACA token. 10% of 30% of Perpetual Futures Exchange Fee is used for ALPACA buyback and distributed as revenue sharing to Governance Vault stakers (as Protocol APR) 6% of 30% of Perpetual Futures Exchange Fee goes towards weekly buybacks and burns of the ALPACA token. 6% of 19% of the AF2.0's Lending Performance Fee is used for ALPACA buyback and distributed as revenue sharing to Governance Vault stakers (as Protocol APR). 4% of 19% of the AF2.0's Lending Performance Fee goes towards weekly buybacks and burns of the ALPACA token. Through adding mechanisms like these, most of the rewards from the ALPACA platform will soon be directly or indirectly shared with ALPACA token holders. You can also check Alpaca Finance's Revenue Distribution here. Why have we chosen to go with token burn in some cases instead of direct fee distribution? Because burn is also a method of fee distribution, only it's more efficient at increasing token price. Burn directly lowers available supply which increases the value of the remaining tokens. Instead of giving out protocol earnings as yields that users can, and often do, dump on the market, through burn, these earnings embed into the token price itself, which discourages selling because users would have to sell part of their principal. This is a more effective way of both rewarding long-term holders, and creating them. Deflationary Price Increase ALPACA tokens are long-term deflationary. Emissions have a hardcap and are continuing to decrease, while burn is permanent and continuing to increase, and we burn quite a bit of tokens; A significant portion of protocol fees go towards token burn: 80% of all liquidation fees and 10% of all protocol lending interest earned by lenders. So as Alpaca Finance continues growing, more ALPACA will be burnt, leading to the value of each remaining ALPACA token rising continuously and permanently. Governance The Governance function is now live. User can lock ALPACA in the Governance vault and receive platform's revenue sharing and participate in governance discussion and voting. You can learn more about Governance here. Exclusive Earning Opportunities Through partnerships, we regularly provide token rewards from our Grazing Range program available only for ALPACA holders who lock their ALPACA in the governance vault. Exclusive NFT Access We are planning to integrate NFTs with actual utility into the platform. Users will have to hold ALPACA in order to benefit from this utility, as well as to gain access to these NFTs in the first place, along with other exclusive items such as real-world Alpaca merch. ALPAnomics Fair Launch Tokenomics Distribution 87% of our total supply will be distributed to the users of the protocol--a genuine fair launch, with less than 9% of the tokens vesting to the team over a two-year period. Over these two years, ALPACA will be released with a decaying emissions schedule. In total, there will be 188 million ALPACA. To incentivize early adopters, there was a bonus rewards period for the first two weeks. Below is our planned block reward schedule. Based on it, the circulating supply profile of ALPACA can be plotted. Please note that although it is also monthly like the Stronk schedule, the below schedule adv",

Warchest There is an allocation of 8 million tokens reserved for future strategic expenses. These include listing fees, audits, third-party services, liquidity for partnerships, etc. 250,000 of these tokens were used to seed PancakeSwap's ALPACA-wBNB pool. To avoid dilution to token holders, we've also implemented a restriction. No more than 200,000 tokens (~2.5% of the 8 million) can be withdrawn each month, with the only exception being if there is prior approval from a community vote.

It was introduced to fit all the needs of the different stakeholders in the ecosystem. How is the ATF priced? Oracle pools will price ATFs value against USDC, WETH, WBTC, USDT and any other major token used in DeFi. Being deflationary (15% of the paid fees are burned after every swap) is a core property of the ATF token. This mechanism aims at protecting its holders. With every burn, the value of ATF increases theoretically. This might be a good investment for ATF token holder who wants to stay passive holders! Over time, the supply will shrink and as long as Antfarm's pools hold liquidity, ATF will maintain a strong valuation and utility. Liquidity Providers can claim their fees at any moment, without any impact on the pool value or volume as these fees are paid with the ATF token. This has many advantages: LPs can further custom their strategy by deciding if they should reinvest their collected fees, diversify into new pools or simply keep them in ATF. By introducing the ATF, we give LPs the ability to create new source of earnings, independently from their initial pool strategy. Crypto-native projects are incentivised to launch liquidity pools with their own token in the Antfarm ecosystem. It gives them the opportunity to put their stack at work. They can use their collected fees (in ATF) to pay their day-to-day expenses as a company. It prevents them from selling their own token to do so. For very risky pairs, if one asset value goes to 0, the LPs will lose all their stake in the pair. Thanks to Antfarm's fee system in ATF, even if one of the assets goes to 0, they would be compensated with a certain % from swapping fees. This is a strong risk mitigation. Increased demand during strong market movements Antfarm is even greater when markets are turbulent! This is when most swappers will be drawn to our pools. As ATF are required to pay for all swapping fees, the demand for ATF will be become substantial in such times. ATF could become a natural hedge against turbulent market, as its demand will increase when markets become volatile.

Additionally, users need to stake iZi token to acquire ve-iZi token, which is izumi platform's governance token that enables holders to be eligible for a range of benefits and participate in governance. iZUMi DAO veNFT（veiZi） Note: iZUMi Finance will launch veNFT when the platform starts DAO governance with the iZUMi community. 1. What is iZUMi DAO veNFT(veiZi)？ iZUMi DAO veNFT(veiZi) is the governance token of iZUMi Finance. veiZi is designed to fully represent the governance rights of iZUMi Finance. veiZi, calculated by the locked iZi number and time, describes the voting power. veiZi is compatible with the ERC721 standard, which could be transferred and traded as other NFT. 2. How to calculate the voting power of veiZi? x1x_1x1: locked number (iZi) x2x_2x2: locked time left (block), maximum 4 years veiZi voting power = x1(x2/4yrs)x_1*(x_2/4 yrs)x1(x2/4yrs) Note: This algorithm sets the voting power of veiZi to be both amount- and time-weighted, which is suitable to represent a community members support and confidence in iZUMi Finance. 3. What are the functions of veiZi? Voting: DAO governance and Quadratic voting will be adopted to determine key issues. Every cycles iZi emissions will be determined and allocated according to veiZi voting power. The owner of the veiZi can delegate the voting right to another address. Staking: 50% of platform revenue will be used to buy back iZi and sent to veiZi holders according to voting power every month. In the first 4 yrs, 40M iZi per year staking incentives will be sent to veiZi holders. Boosting: With NFT staked, veiZi will be used to boost the LiquidBox pool APR up to 2.5x. The boost mechanism will calculate your earning weight by taking the smaller amount of two values. The first value is simple, it's the amount of vliquidity calculated from the LP NFT the user staked on the iZUMi platform. This amount is your maximum earning weight. min((vliquidity40/100)+(TotalvliquidityVotingPower/VotingTotal(10040)/100）,vliquidity)min((vliquidity40/100)+(Total vliquidityVoting Power/Voting Total(10040)/100）,vliquidity)min((vliquidity40/100)+(TotalvliquidityVotingPower/VotingTotal(10040)/100）,vliquidity) Note: This algorithm is designed according to the CURVE boosting algorithm. The incentives for farming pools are distributed at a certain ratio in a scenario where unconsumed emissions will be distributed to $veiZi holders. 4. How to get veiZi? Any address could mint veiZi by locking iZi for a certain locked time. Any address could transfer or receive veNFT, which means veNFT could be traded on the NFT marketplace like Opensea. Any address could add iZi into any veiZi without affecting the locked time Any address could combine A veNFT to B veNFT if Bs locked time is longer than As, and As locked number will be added into Bs. Only the owners address could extend the locked time up to 4 yrs, unlocking in advance is not supported. 5. How to redeem veiZi? The users could redeem veiZi and get back locked iZi after the locked time (block) has been reached. 6. How to use/stake veiZi with your address? Staking: every address could stake one and only one veiZi. Unstaking is available",

Why do you need veiZi? veiZi reduces the circulation of iZi in the secondary market veiZi could get staking rewards every month, making it into an interest-bearing asset. Stake veiZi once and it could be used unlimited times to boost the reward of farming pools. No worry about the liquidity of locked iZi. veiZi can be traded in the mainstream NFT market, like Opensea.

But before they WERE vanquished, the humans had to discard the evidence of what they created. They fired the Chimpers DNA into the voids of space, hoping that their creation would never see the light of day. However, destiny would not allow it. Centuries passed and new worlds forged. The Chimpers extended across the galaxies, species were formed, and a new age began. With 100 Genesis Chimpers first inhabiting the world, now, 5,555 Chimpers exist across the intergalactic warp. A world of warriors, gods, demons, mages, AND space travellers standing at the cusp of an empire at the brink of war. Soon, the concepts of time and space will no longer separate you from them. The Chimpverse awaits you! it's time to bring a new wave of pixel art to the scene...

The work is being developed with the number 108 as the keyword; a combination of 108 backgrounds and flower colors make up a field, and there are 108 fields. Each field has 108 flower images, resulting in 11,664 flower images in total. The number 108 is a reference to bonn, or earthly temptations. The distribution process will proceed as follows. Friends & Family Whitelist Public Sale Lucky 727 Proof Zen Number Proof Bonn Proof Whitelist will mainly consist of the holders of RTFKTs Clone X with Murakami Drip, of which there are 3,000. In addition, there will be Murakami-related Whitelist of 500, as well as Friends & Family. I plan to set aside 4,000 for the Whitelist and Friends & Family together. (The unclaimed quantity after the Whitelist and Friends & Family distributions will be offered through Public Sale.) 6,751 will subsequently be offered through Public Sale, which will be a lottery. Then comes the Lucky 727 Proof, 727 being Takashi Murakamis lucky number. After that, there are 78 in the Zen Number Proof, and the Bonn Proof has 108 for the number of earthly temptations. I intend to release these last two one day, when the time is ripe. The purchase will be limited to one flower per MetaMask wallet. At the time of the release, each will be distributed as a “seed,” which can be evolved into (redeemed as) a flower at the time of Reveal after the Public Sale. There is no knowing which of the 11,664, individually hand-generated flowers your seed will turn into until the time of Reveal. Sales Price Whitelist Presale： 0.0727 ETH Public Sale: 0.108 ETH About Pink & White Flowers The 108 Pink & White flower designs were born out of the first iteration of this project in March, 2021. At first I tried to release them in an auction format on OpenSea, but because I was unable to prepare my own smart contract, I took them down. I have already produced merchandise, prints, and paintings with these first 108 designs, Pink & White 1 through 108; even a QR code is assigned to each, and they are linked to my old OpenSea project mentioned above. I consider all this an event of a generation ago, and plan to leave it as is, as a time capsule. They are therefore not going to be part of the release this time, though if, after I do related exhibitions and go through other processes of recognition, some people still wish to have these works, I may explore offering them for sale then. MIND MAP 1 Vision and Values 2 Community 3 Metaverse 4 A Bridge Between 5 Ecosystem 6 Physical World 1 Vision and Values Murakami.Flowers (M.F hereafter) is being activated upon the system of Superflat, a theory that artist Takashi Murakami put forth in 2000. Superflat refers to the cultural concept generated in Japan in the 77 years since its overwhelming defeat in the Pacific War. The concept stands in opposition to Pop. Superflat refers to the aesthetic concept of social construction by the defeated: Japan, which cannot institute a structure in which the victor defines the righteousness of society in its post-war cultural structure, has instead established an anti-pyramidal hierarchy. At the root of the narrative formation in Japanese manga, anime, and 'light novels' is this seemingly negative sense of never being able to fully endorse the winner. However, perhaps you could also say that the inverted ideas within this aesthetic of the negative has created a universal structure of beauty that transcends national boundaries. This is why there are many Japanese imageries scattered throughout this work. The losers also have their arguments, as well as their ideas of beauty. I hope to visualize such a landscape in this project. CLOSE 2 Community M.F is an attempt to generate a worldview that joins the contemporary art world—the existing art community of which I have been a member—and the new NFT art or digital art community. I intend to create my NFT art based on the method that I believe, in the long run, will let my work survive through in the future art world 100 or 200 years from now, by extending the skills that I have already cultivated to survive on the frontlines of the art market for over 30 years. CLOSE 3 Metaverse I am considering the “meta” of metaverse in relation to the “meta” of metafiction. The “meta” of metafiction seems to be a structure that raises questions about the relationship between fiction and reality by deliberately (self-referentially) making the reader aware that it is a fiction, but it reminds me of a nestling structure, a matryoshka-like structure of a story, and that meta structure is the reality of 'meta' in my mind. In that sense, I am hoping to create M.F as a meta structure of my history as a painter. (I vaguely understand that this usage of “meta” may be widely different from that in metaverse, but here, I am prioritizing my own interpretation.) I believe most of you who are reading this dont know my background as an artist. I am Japanese, an artist, and have been creating work as a professional since when I was 29. I am constantly thinking about whether the value of my work can effectively be sustained for as long as possible after my death, and that is the only thing in my mind as I continue to create artworks; I live to create. Below, I have explained my past as an artist and why I decided to create M.F. Let us start When I was around 17. I was a stupid high school student who actually wanted to be a manga or anime creator, because I vaguely liked to draw pictures. But I didn't have any talent in drawing manga, and I was so stupid as to rank around 530 - 540th out of 550 students in my grade at my bottom-level high school. I wasnt smart enough to go to a normal university, either, so I decided to go to the art university I could enter just based on a drawing exam. I further chose to study in the Japanese Painting (nihonga) Department because the competition was relatively low among various departments. (Incidentally, the most popular department at the time was Oil Painting, with 65 times more people applying than spots available, so those who passed the exam were treated as geniuses! The Design Department had 55 times more applicants, whereas Japanese Painting had around 25 applicants per spot… Well, it was still a challenge at the time, but the ratio was the lowest among the departments.) Among the painting subjects you study in the nihonga course were 'snow, moon, and flowers,” as well as 'flowers, birds, wind, and moon”—traditional themes of natural beauty. I personally loved flowers, so I studied a lot about them, which led me to create the paintings of flower characters that you all know today. I was in the world of Japanese historical paintings until I, at age 26, was awakened to the world of Western-style contemporary art. This was at the tail end of the major New Painting (American Neo-Expressionism) boom in New York. So I moved from Tokyo to New York and became a contemporary artist. This time, I'm taking a big step away from the world of New York-style contemporary art and into the world of the metaverse. My awakening to the metaverse happened in the summer of 2020, the first year of the pandemic, when I saw the way my children interact with 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons.” One day they were watching some fireworks display within the game while talking on Zoom with their school friends, whom they could no longer meet in person, admiring wholeheartedly how beautiful it was. I saw the reality of the shifting values when I realized that these children could discern beauty within a small video game screen. This experience was similar to the one I had when I first encountered contemporary art at the age of 26, when I was shocked by how there was always a gap between what you saw and the concept",

        "input": ", and realized that once I understood the context behind the gap, the artworks took on entirely different appearances. I shuddered with a sensation that made me want to roar in excitement. And riding on the momentum of that sensation, on March 31, 2021, I started to release 108 images called Murakami.Flowers on OpenSea. As I learned more about the NFT world, however, I realized that I was totally unprepared and withdrew the sales on April 11. Although I didn't actually sell any NFT then, as a result of this action I have since received a number of invitations to participate in auctions and new NFT projects, and I declined almost all of them. The reason was that it seemed as though the interests in the NFT art at auctions were concentrated only on the numbers game, and I found myself also overly concerned about the market trends than about NFT's creative potential. So I decided to first take a deep breath and cool my head down. Then, I received a really casual invitation from RTFKT to collaborate. I felt that I could learn a lot about metaverse from these young people. I also thought that their genuine love for sneakers was so intense that I could trust them, so I accepted their invitation. In the meantime, my company has been developing a handheld Tamagotchi-style game to immerse ourselves in the world of games, and we have also been preparing our own smart contract for M.F. Clone X project with RTFKT was released in November 2021, and at the moment I'm still amazed at the magnitude of reaction it generated. And now, I am releasing M.F in the Year of the Tiger, 2022. There are 12 signs in the Chinese zodiac: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and boar. I was born in the Year of the Tiger and this is the fifth time my sign has come around in my life, which means I am 60 years old this year. Normally, 60 years old may indicate you are in the final stage of life, but as I said earlier, my artworks are designed so that their mechanism would start working after my death. So this is truly the start line for me. And the figure above signifies such a worldview. I tried to recreate in the digital world a scene where the foot of Japan's sacred mountain, Fuji, is in full bloom with cherry blossoms. I drew a delusional picture of a future virtual space where, along with M.F, my various titles and business endeavors will be reconstructed in the digital world. CLOSE 6 Physical World A staff photo at Tonari no Zingaro, Murakamis fashion item store in Nakano, Tokyo Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd., which is producing M.F, has worked in the past in the real world creating artworks such as paintings, sculptures, CGI live-action films, TV-series-style animations, etc., and in the world of luxury fashion and music industry by collaborating with famous and powerful brands and musicians. I would like to create work with the theme of bridging between this worldview and the digital world. CLOSE 4 A Bridge Between In December, 2022, I am planning to release a portable game with an LCD monitor. In addition, I plan to start developing and producing online and digital games. I am also planning to activate events in the real-world art community as mentioned earlier. I believe that M.F will also spread to exhibitions in art venues around the world. CLOSE 5 Ecosystem The art world operates as an ecosystem entirely different from those of stocks and commodities. It is a cultural synthesis and marketplace with a huge scale of its own. As it is already trading NFT art and is operating with the DAO-like worldview, I believe it is M.Fs mission to connect it with those who inhabit the worlds of NFT and DAO. CLOSE Events As a starter, I will have an exhibition in May, 2022 at Gagosian, the top contemporary art gallery in the world, at their Madison Avenue location in NY. The plan is to exhibit works based on Clone X, the collaboration project with RTFKT, my brethren in the world of NFT art, as well as real-world paintings of M.F, among other physical works. I also hope to create opportunities for people to encounter in person through salons and club events on that occasion.

Learn more > < The Heart Project was created by visual artist Stefan Meier and photographer/director Aidan Cullen in September of 2021. Over the past two years, Stefan has developed a series of drawings and paintings inspired by cherished cartoons of his childhood. The creation he felt most drawn to was a heart caricature, for its simple and universal message of love. Teaming up Aidan, a fellow artist and NFT enthusiast, the two assembled a dedicated team to build a community surrounding the character with the goal of making the world a better place for artists. Aidan CullenAidan is a 23 year old photographer, director and creative director born and raised in Santa Monica and Venice. Navigating between the music, fashion, documentary and narrative worlds, Aidan has worked on music videos, album covers, commercial campaigns, and magazine covers over the course of his career. In 2021, Aidan dove deeply into web3.0 and founded The Heart Project; a community driven creative studio funded through NFTs. Stefan MeierStefan Meier is a multidisciplinary artist based in Los Angeles. He works in painting, drawing, collage, and textile design. Past collaborators include David LaChapelle, Bernhard Willhelm, Darren Romanelli, K.B. Lee, Maxfield Los Angeles, LN-CC in London, GR8 in Tokyo, Mr. Porter, and Netflix. He had his first solo show of paintings in Los Angeles at Over The Influence Gallery, in January 2022. What are the main utilities of a Heart project NFT? There are 3 main utilities to being a part of the Heart Project 1. Being able to pitch creative ideas to the DAO and receive grants. If the community picks your idea as a winner, THP gives you the necessary funding and production resources to make your vision come to life. 2. Working with established artists, brought in by the Hearts team, to make collaborative creative projects in which the community shares ownership. 3. Having exclusive access to Heart Project parties, experiences, airdrops, clothing, and more.' What is an NFT? A Non-Fungible Token, or NFT, is a digital contract representing ownership of digital media like art, music, videos, memes and even real-world objects like designer sneakers and real estate. Non-fungible basically means unique. Each NFT has a unique code or address that exists on the blockchain, an online digital database that records transactions. Think of this as a digital certificate of ownership. If you buy the image of a Heart, each carries with it a unique code indicating it's yours. You access your NFT through a private key which links to the blockchain and indicates proof of ownership. When did the project launch? The Heart Project launched in September of 2021. Where can I purchase Heart Project NFTs? You can purchase a Heart NFT on Opensea, Looksrare, or coinbase NFT. What's the best way to keep up with the latest announcements? Twitter and discord! What intellectual property rights do Heart holders receive? Owners of Hearts have full commercial art rights for the Heart NFTs that they own. Full CC0. Which blockchain?

DeFi(Decentralized Finance) is constantly evolving. Most investors entering the DeFi space either , dont have the time to properly manage a portfolio of yield farming strategies or struggle to navigate all the steps , required to participate. Empire Capital provides an effective solution and removes the need for active management , by the user. Empire Capital is the easy button for DeFi investing. , Build, Cryptocurrency is ever-evolving, and the technology and use-case are advancing rapidly. Empire Capital looks to , capitalize on its innovative technology and other project ventures whose ideas could change the landscape as we , know it. Empire Capital is contracting out its developers to help build third-party projects by offering infrastructure , services. Empire Capital receives time-locked investments into ECC in return for developmental services. These ser-, vices benefit the Empire Capitals community and partners in addition to spreading awareness as a helping hand in , shaping the future of cryptocurrency. , Bridge, Empire Capital looks to bring forth a new era where all cryptocurrency and fiat are easily interchangeable and read-, ily available. Empire Capital believes its Rounding Up App - Roundify - will be a bridge from CeFi to DeFi and act as , a DeFi normalization stepping stone to the vision Empire Capital hopes to achieve. Roundify will allow investors entry , into ECC and other crypto-index funds without navigating the many steps it takes to participate as it is now. In addi-, tion, Roundify will be informative regarding innovative cryptocurrency projects on the market, and most importantly, it , will provide easy access for CeFi investors to DeFi Projects. Empire Capital is not only a FaaS DeFi project; it is a team , of builders and innovators diversifying yields within and well beyond DeFi. , Empire Capital is not only a FaaS DeFi project, it is a team of builders and innovators diversifying yields within and , beyond DeFi. The services offered is at a minimum three-fold; providing management of high yield DeFi assets for our , users, providing cross-chain infrastructure and developmental support for new cryptocurrency innovators looking to , implement products within the DeFi space, and pioneering the seamless connection between everyday CeFi investors , and the DeFi ecosystem., Mission, Since our inception, our mission has been to simplify investing and building Decentralized Finance projects while , making it universally accessible and beneficial. Today, people turn to Empire Capital for peace of mind when look-, ing for developmental support or to invest. We are grateful to offer such services. As the cryptocurrency landscape , continues to advance, we will stay adaptive and committed to maintaininvg an exceptional level of support., , 2.01 Tokenomics , On each purchase of ECC, there is a 10% fee. 9% of the buy fee is distributed amongst the existing , holders according to their ECC amount. 1% is removed from existence, as Empire Capitals burn , mechanism results in a proper burn. The vast majority of “tax tokens” offer a burn function in their con-, tract, which sends “burned” tokens to a “dead-wallet” or “black-hole wallet” as their deflation meth-, od. These burn methods do not affect the total supply, and the burn wallets end up stealing yield/, reflections from actual holders. By implementing a true 1% burn on every buy, ECCs total supply , will constantly deflate while your balance continuously increases against an ever-deflating supply. , These tokenomics create a proper supply-and-demand metric for ECC as it becomes increasingly , scarce with volume., Holders, New Buyer 1% Burn 9% Reflection, Buy, 10% , Defi 3.0 yield, Sell 2% Auto-LP 4% Treasury 4% Marketing , 10% (Hold ECC, get a share of 0.05% of , EmpireDex fees that the ECC treasury own), Invest in other yield generating , assets as part of treasury , On each sell/transfer of $ECC, there is a 10% fee. 4% is allocated to the ECC treasury, where funds are issued , to invest or farm in projects to increase the value of the treasury portfolio. Moreover, Empire Capital may issue , treasury funds to purchase ECC tokens to be burned, thus raising the price floor while lowering the total supply. , In addition, 4% of each sell will be allocated to a marketing wallet for advertising across mainstream and social , media to spread awareness about Empire Capital and the services provided. Finally, 2% of each sell will be added , to liquidity, as it is essential and beneficial to the stability of ECC that a healthy amount of liquidity is maintained to , promote longevity and a less volatile chart. Greater liquidity enables larger purchases or sells of ECC, enabling , large-capital backers to invest in the token more effectively., Maximum Supply: 100,000,000 ECC, 10% Buy Fee, 9% of each buy goes to existing holders., 1% of each buy is burned from the supply forever., 10% Sell/Transfer fee, 4% of each sell goes into the treasury fund which will then go into multi-chain farming or to buyback ECC tokens., 4% of each sell goes into marketing ECC to bring more awareness into Empire Capital ecosystem., 2% of each sell goes into is used to create more liquidity (ECC/BNB LP)., Supply Supply decreases with Demand, Demand, We have implemented a true 1% burn on every buy so that our total supply will constantly be deflating around your , balance while your balance is constantly increasing against an ever-deflating supply. Creating a true supply/de-, mand metric to the ECC token as it becomes ever so scarce with volume., 2.03 Governance, Voting, ECC holders will be able to make proposals on strategies and vote on these proposals. 1 ECC will , equal to1 voting point. There is a minimum requirement of holding 150,000 ECC to make a proposal., 1 ECC = 1 Voting point, Proposal, Holders can create or make , proposals for the strategy , fund, Proposal can only be placed if you, have over 150,000 $ECC, DeFi - CeFi, ECC/Sanem Digitals Cefi - Defi , RUA (Rounding Up App), Empire Capital has gone a step further in diversifying potential yields by beginning to examine traditional finance , strategies as a registered corporation in New Zealand. Empire Capital LTD has partnered with Sanem Digital, direct-, ed by Michael Moran, an ex-Deloitte alumnus, and partner. Under the expertise of Michael Moran, Empire Capital , LTD will use treasury funds combined with angel funds to invest in CeFi(Centralized/Traditional Finance) startups, , private sales, IPOs, etc. , The vast majority of people in the world have not participated in cryptocurrencies. More often than not, this results , from the barriers presented to new investors when first entering the world of DeFi. Empire Capital aims to be the ac-, cess point for new users to enter the decentralized world. The main problem many hesitant investors face with cryp-, tocurrencies is the lack of accessibility. Empire Capital and Sanem Digital have begun bridging the gap by creating , a Roundify to offer a more efficient entry point into DeFi from fiat., Introducing Roundify, To appeal to those unfamiliar with the necessary steps to partake in DeFi, we must offer a product that provides easier , access to its ecosystem in order",

Roundify is a Round-Up application that , uses open banking technology to allow a round-up of transactions to be swept into crypto investments on a pre-con-, figured cadence, e.g., daily, weekly, monthly. For example, a user would link their bank account to Roundify, and if a , purchase was made for $2.80 for a cup of coffee, the app would Round-Up the purchase to $3.00, and that remain-, ing $.20 would then be invested into a DeFi project such as ECC. The user configures the round-ups as the nearest , dollar, 5 dollars or 10 dollars, etc. In addition, there are other investment features such as one-off transactions within , pre-configured limits. For example, instead of buying cigarettes, a user can invest a one-off sum to see the benefits of , quitting a bad habit; and make Regular payments the day after payday, etc. The app will also include a dashboard , display of investments to track progress., The benefits of Roundify are ever-expanding for ECC, DeFi, and users alike. The Roundify acts as a crypto shortcut for , fiat investors and crypto novices while increasing the normalcy of DeFi cryptocurrencies as a whole. Specifically for , ECC, the benefits include; increased buying pressure, reduced friction for the community by simplifying investing fiat , into ECC, validation as the primary partner for the app with an outsized say in the development roadmap, and the , managing the curation of partners who will have access to this technology. Roundify will be available in the Apple , and Android stores., How does Roundify fit into Empire Capitals partner Sanem Digitals existing product ecosystem? Sanem Digital has , several proprietary platforms, including a member-only travel booking platform. Since Sanem Digital has developed , Roundify, the functionality has been designed for future releases to allow users to earn travel dollars which can be , used on hotels using the Sanem Digital travel platform., How does RUA fit into Sanem Digitals existing product ecosystem?, Sanem Digital has a number of proprietary platforms which includes a member only travel booking platform.

The value of ETRNL will rise as more users invest USDC and when ETRNL tokens are sold and staked / sacrificed. Initial Token Allocation The initial token minted is 150,000 tokens. Allocation: 50,000 - Public Presale Round 1 - 1.25 USDC per ETRNL 50,000 - Public Presale Round 2 - 1.50 USDC per ETRNL 16,000 - Team allocation total (4,000 each x4) 14,000 - Influencer and Subscriber Giveaway 20,000 - Reserved in Treasury The team will have have to control the price of ETRNL Token so a burn and mint function is necessary to execute this. Aside from the initial 20,000 ETRNL, the contract has a function to mint 10,000 ETRNL Token per 7 days. This will not be redeemed unless needed. Presale Information Presale Round 1: Public Presale (i.e. No whitelist) 50,000 tokens available at 1.25 USDC each 50 USDC Min and 2.500 USDC Max You can only buy ONCE during each round, make it count! Presale Round 2: Public Presale (i.e. No whitelist) 50,000 tokens available at 1.50 USDC each 100 USDC Min and 5.000 USDC Max You can only buy ONCE during each round, make it count! Presale Fund Allocation: 50% - Locked in Eternal Main Contract 30% - External Income Generation 10% - Marketing Fund 10% - Team Price Estimation on Launch It is impossible to calculate the price of the token on launch as it depends on the amount of tokens that are staked. But we can give you an idea on how the price would be. See the FF scenarios: If 80% of the tokens purchased on pre-sale are staked the price of ETRNL will be 1.67 USDC. If 90% of the tokens purchased on pre-sale are staked the price of ETRNL will be 2.05 USDC. If 100% of the tokens purchased on pre-sale are staked the price of ETRNL will be 2.58 USDC. Minting ETRNL Users can earn 1% ETRNL from investing USDC. Users will earn ETRNL tokens as a percentage of USDC invested irrespective of the ETRNL price i.e. If the user invest 100 USDC they will receive 1 ETRNL per day. Users cannot unstake deposited USDC tokens. Staking ETRNL Users can earn 2% ETRNL from depositing ETRNL. Users cannot unstake their ETRNL tokens. Selling ETRNL Users can sell ETRNL for USDC based on the current price of ETRNL. Accounts are limited to one ETRNL sale per week. Investors may be taxed based on the anti-dump and anti-whale mechanics. Deposit Jackpots The platform has 2 deposit jackpot features. Last deposit jackpot, 0.5% of each deposit will be put into the rewards pool. Last deposit address will win the pot after 12 hours if no one else deposit after him. The pot for each round will start at 500 USDC and has a 2,000 USDC limit. Event can run every 1 hour up to 24 hours depending on the project owners setting. Top Deposit Jackpot, biggest deposit in 48 hours timeframe will win 2% back as cashback . Event can run every 1 day to 7 days depending on the project owners setting. Anti Whale Mechanics On staking claims, a whale tax will kick in if the user claim exceeds 1% of the ETRNL token supply. Tax is determined by preset brackets defined by the percentage of supply as follows: 0% - 0.99% of supply => 0% tax 1% - 1.99% of supply => 5% tax 2% - 2.99% of supply => 10% tax 3% - 3.99% of supply => 15% tax 4% - 4.99% of supply => 20% tax 5% - 5.99% of supply => 25% tax 6% - 6.99% of supply => 30% tax 7% - 7.99% of supply => 35% tax 8% - 8.99% of supply => 40% tax 9% - 9.99% of supply => 45% tax 10% - 100% of supply => 50% tax Anti Dump Mechanics Users will be charged with 50% Tax if they sell more than 25% of their total ETRNL Stakes and if they have no ETRNL staked in the platform. Anti Freeloader Mechanics This is done to force users to stake USDC if they *magically* acquired ETRNL. A user must stake USDC and ETRNL in a 1:1 ratio (or more). This includes team, influencers, and giveaway recipients. Max Payout There is a 250% Max Payout for ETRNL Stakes including the deposited ETRNL. ETRNL Price Calculation Total Supply : The amount of ETRNL tokens that are currently in wallets. ETRNL Price : (Total USDC Balance / Total Supply) Referral Bonuses Taxes from Staking, Claims and Selling Tokens will be used for paying out referrals Get rewards for 5 levels in your downline Round robin style to prevent self referring Flat 3% affiliate commission Taxes Invest : 0% on USDC, 5% on ETRNL. Claim : 10% Compound : 5% Sell : 20% All Taxes will stay or be burned in the contract. Deposit Fee The only fee for the team will be for new USDC Deposits. External Revenue Aside from the 30% of the presale funds and depending on the investors funds to generate income for the protocol, the team will also be using an additional 30% of all deposited BUSD in the platform to be invested in other platforms to generate external revenue. The investors invested will remain 100% and won't need to worry about their total investment being deducted. Community We love our community and we want to know your thoughts!

The Worlds Most Hyper burn token: 2% Supply Burned Daily & 1% Burned on each transaction. +99% tokens burned & locked The AI burning mechanism burns 2% of the supply daily in the whole system, leading to a daily price increase ~2%, following a parabolic price curve. Based on calculations, 1 THOREUM will be equivalent to 1 ETH in just 257 days. With a 1% burn on each transaction, Thoreum in the wallet of the other party who buys, sells, or transfers is burned, not yours. This gradually increases your share ratio on the whole market cap! If a coin has a rapidly decreasing supply at 2% a day, with +99% of total supply burned and locked, while its liquidity and market cap continue to grow, and your share ratio on the market cap ONLY increases after each transaction, then investing earlier will lead to a higher share ratio on the market cap. Thoreum is designed to act as a store of value, you can reap generational wealth by holding it for a longer period of time due to its rapid value growth. Unlike Bitcoin, THOREUM is deflationary and much less volatile, and you dont have to wait for bulls to make a move. So, why wait any longer? B.
