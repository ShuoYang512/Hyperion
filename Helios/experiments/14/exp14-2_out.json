It is an incredibly lucrative , staking DApp that is built on the shoulders of giants. Drawing , inspiration from the highly successful T2X platform from the , glory days of DeFi; Avarice brings the auction fun and FOMO to , the Binance Smart Chain., Avarice is designed to provide maximum benefit to the stakers. , Users will buy AVC tokens with BNB on our easy to use dApp. , They can then stake their tokens to earn interest paid in AVC , along with their share of the BNB dividends from the daily , 01, 02 auction lobby. Users can make as many stakes they want for as , 03 long as they want up to a maximum of 300 days. The longer the , 04 stake, the more interest you earn, all while enjoying staking , 05 bonuses along the way. Simple., How do you get AVC Tokens?, There are 3 main ways that you can get AVC tokens:, 1. Participate in a daily auction and swap your BNB for , AVC tokens., 2. Refer your friends and earn 5% bonus on all of their , auction entries., 01, 02, 3. Stake AVC to earn daily interest on your stake. (See , 03, 04 \u201ctokenomics\u201d for a full breakdown), 05, Staking System, The staking portal lives on our panel , where users can stake their AVC , tokens for their desired duration up to , 300 days. stakes will accrue daily BNB , dividends based on the amount of , AVC tokens staked, This amount will , vary on the amount of BNB in the , lobby on each day of the stake, stakes , will also receive AVC bonus tokens., 01, 02 Users will be able to collect their , 03 staked tokens and the dividends at , 04 the end of their stakes period. , 05, Bonus Tokens, Users receive bonus AVC tokens on their active stakes which is , highly based on the duration of their stakes. , Longer the duration higher the bonus percentage., The graph shows the growth , of the bonus tokens % for , 01 Stakes, At its highest (which , 02, is 300 days) the percentage , 03, goes up to 105%. , 04, 05, What is the Dividends pool?, 94% of all BNB that enters the daily auction lobby is pooled to be , distributed back out to the stakers, which we call the dividends , pool. At the end of each day the BNB dividend pool will be , calculated and allocated to all of the open stakes based on their , staked amount., How is the Dividends pool calculated?, As shown on the next slide daily dividend payout is split over a period of , time. For example, assuming day 3 ended with a 100 Lobby BNB entry, , that BNB will be divided by 3 as it's day 3, and split out over 3 days in , chunks of 33.3 BNB. Another example; day 10 ends with 100 BNB, these , 06 BNB are split into chunks of 10 which are sent out over 10 days. As the , 07 days go on and the pools grow in size, these dividends will keep going , 08 and adding allowing for much stronger and stable payouts! This caps at , 09 day 60. This also ensures that our project can live a longer lifespan and , 10 adds to the game theory behind the staking of the tokens themselves. , , Auctions!, Auction lobbies are the main way users can acquire AVC, , Each day AVC tokens will be auctioned and users can pledge , BNB and collect AVC tokens at the end of the day proportional to , their contribution., Where does all the BNB go?

Born out of trials and tribulation, the $BNBTIGER community is the strongest community you'll find, supportive of one another, and pushing each other towards success. We are fed up with the fraud projects in the market! These projects have lowered people's trust, led to suspicion and panic, and finally led to the death of one project after another. No more great projects like Shib can be born! The goal of the birth of BNBTiger is to rebuild the security and trust of the market. Like Shib, Let's complete another 260000 X the task. So we launched a huge number of 10.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 tokens, destroyed 50%, and launched fairly! Let's start from zero. This is a new social experiment. We want to see how many zeros can be killed by real trust!
