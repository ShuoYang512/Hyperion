Given these , dynamics, users are encouraged to stay active by frequently 'Compounding', 'Pocketing', , or 'Hiring Miners'\u2014ideally on a daily basis., Compounding:, 'Compounding' (hatching eggs) helps users preserve and grow their positions by , increasing their total number of miners, which in turn captures future value from those , choosing to 'Pocket' (sell eggs) instead.

This in turn earns you more CRO faster. These miners work for you tirelessly, giving you a daily average of 8% of your miners' value. The daily percentage return depends on players' actions that are taken within the platform that impact the miners's efficiency rate. The farming efficiency rate rises and falls as users buy miners, re-hire your earnings and sell your crops for CRO. Once miners are bought/hired, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to re-hire/compound them (either through hire or re-hiring) cannot be taken back."

Using a referral link to hire miners does not affect the number of miners you hire, but it will help surely encourage the community to share more and grow the community of users. Community will drive the success of the project. What makes it different from other similar platforms? The CRO Beans Miner has several anti-dumping and anti-whale measures in place to ensure the longevity of the project. These measures include maximum deposits, as well as a cutoff time AND a cooldown time for withdrawals. The cutoff time is the amount of time it will take for your 'cart' to be full of rewards. Once the bag is full, it will stop filling until you've taken some action in the game. This is to prevent whales from letting their rewards accumulate for a long time, and removes the false impression the contract value is going up when most of it is rewards the whale is waiting to withdraw at once. The withdraw cooldown time is the amount of time one has to wait before they can make another withdrawal. This also prevents the contract balance from decreasing in value too fast. If the team decides it's necessary to protect the contract balance, this time period can be adjusted to slow down the rate of withdrawals, but it can only be set to a value less than or equal to 24 hours (per contract rules). The compound count is the number of times the user has compounded. By default, the required compound count by the platform is 10, meaning the user will have to compound 10 times (compound once every 12 hours) before they can withdraw without the feedback tax of 80%. This feature in essense will ensure the longevity and stability of the project. To reward users who compound, there is a bonus when you re-hire your daily crops earnings instead of selling them. The bonus increases 4% every 12 hours that you compound without withdrawing (40% max after 5 days). This incentivizes the user to compound more often, which will help boost the farms efficiency rate in the long run. To be able to utilize the re-hire bonus feature, the player must not compound before the provided timer reaches "

For the players who choose to not play the game and only sell, there will be a 80% tax on those sells that will stay in the contract. If the player makes two or more consecutive sells, this tax will be applied. The only way for the user to not pay the 80% tax is to compound 10 times before making another withdrawal. How does this platform work? This platform work similarly to a financial market, where an asset has intrinsic value that is relative to the supply or demand of said asset. Miners are purchased with a pre-determined currency at a price relative to the miners's current mining efficiency rate. After the miners are purchased, they go to work for you right away to give you the best yield on your investment possible, for as long as possible. Just as any other asset bought and sold on an open market, the price of a miners will fluctuate over time, as will the mining efficiency rate, as you and other players recruit miners, compound earnings and sell earnings. To put it plainly, the more demand for the miners, the more they will increase in value and the more yield they will produce. Inversely, when the demand decreases, so will the value of the miners and their daily return on investment. The main difference between a this game and a traditional financial market is that a recruited miners cannot be sold, only the value they provide can be sold. As the players of the game as a whole compound their earnings and make new deposits, the game efficiency rate will stay relatively constant, but the moment players start to sell more than they are compounding, the efficiency rate will begin to drop as to preserve the TVL and longevity of the game. What is the recommended strategy? The best strategy that the team can recommend is to re-hire/compound for 6 days and harvest 1 day a week. This will increase the users investment at the same time increasing the daily yield earnings. This strategy has already been tried and tested by several project and is proven effective both for the short and long term.

Price Estimation on Launch: The price of ETRNL will depend on the amount of tokens that are staked. Based on the given scenarios, if 80% of the tokens are staked, the price of ETRNL will be 1.67 USDC, if 90% are staked, the price will be 2.05 USDC, and if 100% are staked, the price will be 2.58 USDC.\n3.

Presale Fund Allocation: 50% of 100 USDC = 50 USDC (locked in main contract), 30% of 100 USDC = 30 USDC (external income generation), 10% of 100 USDC = 10 USDC (marketing), and 10% of 100 USDC = 10 USDC (team).\n2.

When you buy cars , they fill your tank with BNB throughout the day with an estimated daily total of 5% of your TVL. You can Drift or Sprint the BNB accumulated in your tank at any time.

To ensure sustainability and longevity of the project, AND as an enhancement from the previous similar miner game, the Miracle GEMS team has implemented a feature that would encourage/enforce diggers to continuously compound before taking profit. Users should compound X no. of times before they can withdraw. Should a Digger decide not to compound or hire more Diggers using his earnings, and continuously withdraw, digger will be charged with a 80% feedback tax that will remain part of the contract. In Addition, to further encourage the community to re-hire/compound, there will be an additional 3% bonus for each compound action that the user will do, which can stack up to 40% for 10 consecutive times / 5 days. By doing so, this will ensure the long term potential profit of every investor. The best strategy that the team can recommend is to re-hire/compound for 5 days and harvest 1 day a week.

The BUSD GEMS Digger is a decentralized application built on the Binance Smart Chain. The object of the game is to hire more Diggers sooner and more often than other players. This in turn earns you more BUSD faster. These Diggers work for you tirelessly, giving you a daily average of 8% of your Diggers' value. The daily percentage return depends on players' actions that are taken within the platform that impact the Diggers's efficiency rate. The farming efficiency rate rises and falls as users buy Diggers, re-hire your earnings and sell your GEMS for BUSD. Once Diggers are Bought, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to re-hire them (either through hire or re-hiring) cannot be taken back. However, once bought, Diggers will not stop producing yield. What makes it different from other similar platforms? The BUSD GEMS Digger has several anti-dumping and anti-whale measures in place to ensure the longevity of the project. These measures include maximum deposits, as well as a cutoff time AND a cooldown time for withdrawals. The cutoff time is the amount of time it will take for your 'cart"

Once the bag is full, it will stop filling until you've taken some action in the game. This is to prevent whales from letting their rewards accumulate for a long time, and removes the false impression the contract value is going up when most of it is rewards the whale is waiting to withdraw at once. The withdraw cooldown time is the amount of time one has to wait before they can make another withdrawal. This also prevents the contract balance from decreasing in value too fast. If the team decides it's necessary to protect the contract balance, this time period can be adjusted to slow down the rate of withdrawals, but it can only be set to a value less than or equal to 24 hours (per contract rules). The compound count is the number of times the user has compounded. By default, the required compound count by the platform is 10, meaning the user will have to compound 10 times(compound once every 12 hours) before they can withdraw without the feedback tax of 80%. This feature in essense will ensure the longevity and stability of the project. To reward users who compound, there is a bonus when you re-hire your daily GEMS earnings instead of selling them. The bonus increases 4% every 12 hours that you compound without withdrawing (40% max after 5 days). This incentivizes the user to compound more often, which will help boost the farms efficiency rate in the long run. To be able to utilize the re-hire bonus feature, the player must not compound before the provided timer reaches 00:00:00. For the players who choose to not play the game and only sell, there will be a 80% tax on those sells that will stay in the contract. If the player makes two or more consecutive sells, this tax will be applied. The only way for the user to not pay the 80% tax is to compound 10 times before making another withdrawal. How does this platform work? This platform work similarly to a financial market, where an asset has intrinsic value that is relative to the supply or demand of said asset.

Withdraw cooldown time: The text does not mention the exact value of the withdraw cooldown time, but it states that it can be adjusted to slow down the rate of withdrawals and must be less than or equal to 24 hours.\n2. Compound count: The default compound count is 10, which means the user must compound 10 times before they can withdraw without the feedback tax of 80%.\n3. Bonus for re-hiring daily GEMS earnings: The bonus increases 4% every 12 hours that the user compounds without withdrawing, up to a maximum of 40% after 5 days.\n4. Tax on sells: If a player chooses to sell their GEMS instead of compounding, they will be subject to an 80% tax.\n5. Required compound count for no tax: To avoid paying the 80% tax, the player must compound 10 times before making another withdrawal.\n\nBased on these numerical values, we can infer the following about the platform's mechanics:\n\n1. The platform is designed to encourage compounding, as the bonus for re-hiring daily GEMS earnings increases the more frequently the user compounds.\n2. The withdraw cooldown time and compound count requirements are intended to slow down the rate of withdrawals and ensure the longevity of the project.\n3. The tax on sells is a mechanism to discourage players from selling their GEMS and instead encourage them to compound and boost the farms efficiency rate.\n\nOverall, the platform appears to be designed to incentivize long-term participation and compounding, while discouraging short-term selling and withdrawals."

After the Diggers are purchased, they go to work for you right away to give you the best yield on your investment possible, for as long as possible. Just as any other asset bought and sold on an open market, the price of a Diggers will fluctuate over time, as will the mining efficiency rate, as you and other players recruit Diggers, compound earnings and sell earnings. To put it plainly, the more demand for the Diggers, the more they will increase in value and the more yield they will produce. Inversely, when the demand decreases, so will the value of the Diggers and their daily return on investment. The main difference between a this game and a traditional financial market is that a recruited Diggers cannot be sold, only the value they provide can be sold. As the players of the game as a whole compound their earnings and make new deposits, the game efficiency rate will stay relatively constant, but the moment players start to sell more than they are compounding, the efficiency rate will begin to drop as to preserve the TVL and longevity of the game. What is the recommended strategy? The best strategy that the team can recommend is to re-hire/compound for 6 days and harvest 1 day a week. This will increase the users investment at the same time increasing the daily yield earnings. This strategy has already been tried and tested by several project and is proven effective both for the short and long term. Copyright The GEMS Digger Team. All Rights Reserved, "

Withdrawing will reset your bonus to 0. Earn 0% when someone uses your referral link! Frequently Asked Questions What is the BNB Crops Farmers? The BNB Crops Farmer is a decentralized application built on the Binance Smart Chain. The object of the game is to hire more farmers sooner and more often than other farmers. This in turn earns you more BNB faster. These Farmers work for you tirelessly, giving you a daily average of 6% of your farmers' value. The daily percentage return depends on farmers' actions that are taken within the platform that impact the farmers's efficiency rate. The farming efficiency rate rises and falls as users buy Farmers, re-hire your earnings and sell your Crops for BNB. Once Farmers are Bought, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to re-hire them (either through hire or re-hiring) cannot be taken back. However, once bought, Farmers will not stop producing yield. What makes it different from other similar platforms? The BNB Crops Farmer has several anti-dumping and anti-whale measures in place to ensure the longevity of the project. These measures include maximum deposits, as well as a cutoff time AND a cooldown time for withdrawals. The cutoff time is the amount of time it will take for your 'cart' to be full of rewards. Once the bag is full, it will stop filling until you've taken some action in the game. This is to prevent whales from letting their rewards accumulate for a long time, and removes the false impression the contract value is going up when most of it is rewards the whale is waiting to withdraw at once. The withdraw cooldown time is the amount of time one has to wait before they can make another withdrawal. This also prevents the contract balance from decreasing in value too fast. If the team decides it's necessary to protect the contract balance, this time period can be adjusted to slow down the rate of withdrawals, but it can only be set to a value less than or equal to 24 hours (per contract rules). The compound count is the number of times"

By default, the required compound count by the platform is 10, meaning the user will have to compound 10 times(compound once every 12 hours) before they can withdraw without the feedback tax of 80%. This feature in essense will ensure the longevity and stability of the project. To reward users who compound, there is a bonus when you re-hire your daily crops earnings instead of selling them. The bonus increases 2% every 12 hours that you compound without withdrawing (20% max after 5 days). This incentivizes the user to compound more often, which will help boost the farms efficiency rate in the long run. To be able to utilize the re-hire bonus feature, the player must not compound before the provided timer reaches 00:00:00. For the farmers who choose to not play the game and only sell, there will be a 80% tax on those sells that will stay in the contract. If the player makes two or more consecutive sells, this tax will be applied. The only way for the user to not pay the 80% tax is to compound 10 times before making another withdrawal. BNB Crops Farmer also has a very unique feature that has never been done before which effectively decreases the amount of farmers inflation that occurs over a long period of time. Every sell action will only add 50% of the amount sold to the total supply. Older miner add 100% of what is sold to the total supply. This means the contract will have a lower inflation rate, keeping the farmers supply more scarce and more valuable than other miner platforms. How does this platform work? This platform work similarly to a financial market, where an asset has intrinsic value that is relative to the supply or demand of said asset. Farmers are purchased with a pre-determined currency at a price relative to the Farmers's current farming efficiency rate. After the Farmers are purchased, they go to work for you right away to give you the best yield on your investment possible, for as long as possible. Just as any other asset bought and sold on an open market, the price of a Farmers will fluctuate over time, as will"

To put it plainly, the more demand for the Farmers, the more they will increase in value and the more yield they will produce. Inversely, when the demand decreases, so will the value of the Farmers and their daily return on investment. The main difference between a this game and a traditional financial market is that a recruited Farmers cannot be sold, only the value they provide can be sold. As the farmers of the game as a whole compound their earnings and make new deposits, the game efficiency rate will stay relatively constant, but the moment farmers start to sell more than they are compounding, the efficiency rate will begin to drop as to preserve the TVL and longevity of the game. What is the recommended strategy? The best strategy that the team can recommend is to re-hire/compound for 6 days and harvest 1 day a week. This will increase the users investment at the same time increasing the daily yield earnings. This strategy has already been tried and tested by several project and is proven effective both for the short and long term. Copyright The Crops Farmer Team. All Rights Reserved, "

To ensure sustainability and longevity of the project AND as an enhancement from similar miner games, the CRO Beans Miner team has implemented a feature that would encourage/enforce miners to continuously compound before taking profit. Users should compound X no. of times before they can withdraw. Should a miner decide not to compound or hire more miners using their earnings, and continuously withdraw, miner will be charged with a 80% feedback tax that will remain part of the contract. In Addition, to further encourage the community to re-hire/compound, there will be an additional 4% bonus for each compound action that the user will do, which can stack up to 40% for 10 consecutive times / 5 days. By doing so, this will ensure the long term potential profit of every investor. The best strategy that the team can recommend is to re-hire/compound for 6 days and harvest 1 day a week. This will increase the users investment at the same time increasing the daily yield earnings. This strategy has already been tried and tested by several project and is proven effective. High Risk! Funds that are used to initially hire miners (including re-hire) cannot be withdrawn, however your miners will indefinitely work and grow crops for you. Please use the application at your own risk.

The CRO Beans Miner is a decentralized application built on the Cronos chain. The object of the game is to hire more miners sooner and more often than other players. This in turn earns you more CRO faster. These miners work for you tirelessly, giving you a daily average of 8% of your miners' value. The daily percentage return depends on players' actions that are taken within the platform that impact the miners's efficiency rate. The farming efficiency rate rises and falls as users buy miners, re-hire your earnings and sell your crops for CRO. Once miners are bought/hired, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to re-hire/compound them (either through hire or re-hiring) cannot be taken back."

Using a referral link to hire miners does not affect the number of miners you hire, but it will help surely encourage the community to share more and grow the community of users. Community will drive the success of the project. What makes it different from other similar platforms? The CRO Beans Miner has several anti-dumping and anti-whale measures in place to ensure the longevity of the project. These measures include maximum deposits, as well as a cutoff time AND a cooldown time for withdrawals. The cutoff time is the amount of time it will take for your 'cart' to be full of rewards. Once the bag is full, it will stop filling until you've taken some action in the game. This is to prevent whales from letting their rewards accumulate for a long time, and removes the false impression the contract value is going up when most of it is rewards the whale is waiting to withdraw at once. The withdraw cooldown time is the amount of time one has to wait before they can make another withdrawal. This also prevents the contract balance from decreasing in value too fast. If the team decides it's necessary to protect the contract balance, this time period can be adjusted to slow down the rate of withdrawals, but it can only be set to a value less than or equal to 24 hours (per contract rules). The compound count is the number of times the user has compounded. By default, the required compound count by the platform is 10, meaning the user will have to compound 10 times (compound once every 12 hours) before they can withdraw without the feedback tax of 80%. This feature in essense will ensure the longevity and stability of the project. To reward users who compound, there is a bonus when you re-hire your daily crops earnings instead of selling them. The bonus increases 4% every 12 hours that you compound without withdrawing (40% max after 5 days). This incentivizes the user to compound more often, which will help boost the farms efficiency rate in the long run. To be able to utilize the re-hire bonus feature, the player must not compound before the provided timer reaches "

For the players who choose to not play the game and only sell, there will be a 80% tax on those sells that will stay in the contract. If the player makes two or more consecutive sells, this tax will be applied. The only way for the user to not pay the 80% tax is to compound 10 times before making another withdrawal. How does this platform work? This platform work similarly to a financial market, where an asset has intrinsic value that is relative to the supply or demand of said asset. Miners are purchased with a pre-determined currency at a price relative to the miners's current mining efficiency rate. After the miners are purchased, they go to work for you right away to give you the best yield on your investment possible, for as long as possible. Just as any other asset bought and sold on an open market, the price of a miners will fluctuate over time, as will the mining efficiency rate, as you and other players recruit miners, compound earnings and sell earnings. To put it plainly, the more demand for the miners, the more they will increase in value and the more yield they will produce. Inversely, when the demand decreases, so will the value of the miners and their daily return on investment. The main difference between a this game and a traditional financial market is that a recruited miners cannot be sold, only the value they provide can be sold. As the players of the game as a whole compound their earnings and make new deposits, the game efficiency rate will stay relatively constant, but the moment players start to sell more than they are compounding, the efficiency rate will begin to drop as to preserve the TVL and longevity of the game. What is the recommended strategy? The best strategy that the team can recommend is to re-hire/compound for 6 days and harvest 1 day a week. This will increase the users investment at the same time increasing the daily yield earnings.

To ensure sustainability and longevity of the project, AND as an enhancement from the previous similar miner game, the Miracle GEMS team has implemented a feature that would encourage/enforce diggers to continuously compound before taking profit. Users should compound X no. of times before they can withdraw. Should a Digger decide not to compound or hire more Diggers using his earnings, and continuously withdraw, digger will be charged with a 80% feedback tax that will remain part of the contract. In Addition, to further encourage the community to re-hire/compound, there will be an additional 3% bonus for each compound action that the user will do, which can stack up to 40% for 10 consecutive times / 5 days. By doing so, this will ensure the long term potential profit of every investor. The best strategy that the team can recommend is to re-hire/compound for 5 days and harvest 1 day a week. This will increase the users investment at the same time increasing the daily yield earnings. This strategy has already been tried and tested by several project and is proven effective. High Risk! Funds that are used to initially hire diggers (including re-hire) cannot be withdrawn, however your diggers will indefinitely work and dig GEMS for you. Please use the application at your own risk.

Mine GEMS will reset your bonus to 0. Earn -% when someone uses your referral link! Frequently Asked Questions What is the BUSD GEMS Diggers? The BUSD GEMS Digger is a decentralized application built on the Binance Smart Chain. The object of the game is to hire more Diggers sooner and more often than other players. This in turn earns you more BUSD faster. These Diggers work for you tirelessly, giving you a daily average of 8% of your Diggers' value. The daily percentage return depends on players' actions that are taken within the platform that impact the Diggers's efficiency rate. The farming efficiency rate rises and falls as users buy Diggers, re-hire your earnings and sell your GEMS for BUSD. Once Diggers are Bought, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to re-hire them (either through hire or re-hiring) cannot be taken back. However, once bought, Diggers will not stop producing yield. What makes it different from other similar platforms? The BUSD GEMS Digger has several anti-dumping and anti-whale measures in place to ensure the longevity of the project. These measures include maximum deposits, as well as a cutoff time AND a cooldown time for withdrawals. The cutoff time is the amount of time it will take for your 'cart"

Once the bag is full, it will stop filling until you've taken some action in the game. This is to prevent whales from letting their rewards accumulate for a long time, and removes the false impression the contract value is going up when most of it is rewards the whale is waiting to withdraw at once. The withdraw cooldown time is the amount of time one has to wait before they can make another withdrawal. This also prevents the contract balance from decreasing in value too fast. If the team decides it's necessary to protect the contract balance, this time period can be adjusted to slow down the rate of withdrawals, but it can only be set to a value less than or equal to 24 hours (per contract rules). The compound count is the number of times the user has compounded. By default, the required compound count by the platform is 10, meaning the user will have to compound 10 times(compound once every 12 hours) before they can withdraw without the feedback tax of 80%. This feature in essense will ensure the longevity and stability of the project. To reward users who compound, there is a bonus when you re-hire your daily GEMS earnings instead of selling them. The bonus increases 4% every 12 hours that you compound without withdrawing (40% max after 5 days). This incentivizes the user to compound more often, which will help boost the farms efficiency rate in the long run. To be able to utilize the re-hire bonus feature, the player must not compound before the provided timer reaches 00:00:00. For the players who choose to not play the game and only sell, there will be a 80% tax on those sells that will stay in the contract. If the player makes two or more consecutive sells, this tax will be applied. The only way for the user to not pay the 80% tax is to compound 10 times before making another withdrawal.

After the Diggers are purchased, they go to work for you right away to give you the best yield on your investment possible, for as long as possible. Just as any other asset bought and sold on an open market, the price of a Diggers will fluctuate over time, as will the mining efficiency rate, as you and other players recruit Diggers, compound earnings and sell earnings. To put it plainly, the more demand for the Diggers, the more they will increase in value and the more yield they will produce. Inversely, when the demand decreases, so will the value of the Diggers and their daily return on investment. The main difference between a this game and a traditional financial market is that a recruited Diggers cannot be sold, only the value they provide can be sold. As the players of the game as a whole compound their earnings and make new deposits, the game efficiency rate will stay relatively constant, but the moment players start to sell more than they are compounding, the efficiency rate will begin to drop as to preserve the TVL and longevity of the game. What is the recommended strategy? The best strategy that the team can recommend is to re-hire/compound for 6 days and harvest 1 day a week.

Token Details Name: Poop Ticker: POOP Decimals: 18 Total supply: elastic supply Contract: 0x00000065cBADeAD116136940b302F938284f2BDc POOP has no pre-sale and no investor. Up-Only Mechanism POOP adopts an over-collateralized elastic supply mechanism, which guarantees the price of POOP/L1 Coin goes Up-Only. The mint and burn of POOP are supported by the deposits and withdrawals of the L1 Coin Backing Vault. Each time a POOP is minted or burned, a small-portion tax will be charged and collected by the Backing Vault. This ensures that the reserved L1 Coin in the Backing Vault will always increase at a greater rate than the total supply of POOP. The Backing Vault is a smart contract (not a wallet address) and nobody can ever manipulate the L1 Coins in it. Code is the law. Here's an example: POOP on BNB Chain adopts a 10% tax (60% of which is used for over-collateralization) Mint POOP When a user pays 1 BNB to mint POOP 0.9 BNB for mint, of which 100% goes into the Backing Vault 0.1 BNB for tax, of which 60% goes into the Backing Vault, 40% goes into the development fund This results in Contract mints 0.9 BNB worth of POOP, Backing Vault adds 0.96 BNB collateral, Value of BNB reserved (0.96 BNB) > value of POOP minted"

Withdraw Rewards Strategy: This strategy involves regularly withdrawing your earned rewards from the smart contract. By withdrawing your rewards, you can enjoy immediate access to the profits generated by your investment. This approach allows you to realize short-term gains and use the funds for other purposes or investments. 2. Compound Rewards Strategy: The compound rewards strategy involves reinvesting your earned rewards back into the smart contract. Instead of withdrawing the rewards, you leave them in the contract, allowing them to compound over time. Compounding refers to reinvesting the earned rewards to generate additional profits. This approach can lead to exponential growth of your initial investment, as the compounded rewards generate more rewards over time. Both strategies have their advantages and considerations. The 'Withdraw Rewards' strategy provides regular income and flexibility in using the funds, while the 'Compound Rewards' strategy offers the potential for long-term exponential growth. The choice between the two strategies depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial needs. It's important to note that the Reward Capital project provides you with the flexibility to switch between the two strategies at any time. This allows you to adapt your approach based on market conditions and your personal preferences. It's recommended to regularly review your investment strategy and make informed decisions based on your financial objectives.

How to get started? Functions & Features Snyper Fund Mystery NFT's Play 2 Earn Ecosystem Audits Website Contract The Stamp Audit Telegram Chat Telegram Announcements Powered By GitBook Welcome to Snyper Fund ! Snyper Fund Staking DApp, is a revolutionary platform that offers users the opportunity to stake their funds and generate constant returns indefinitely. The Snyper Fund Staking DApp operates on a robust mechanism that combines various features to provide users with a rewarding staking experience. Users can stake their funds within the Snyper Fund DApp, with the promise of a 3% daily Return on Investment (ROI). The DApp incorporates a compound feature that increases users' ROI even further. Users can compound their returns daily, adding an additional 1% compound bonus to the daily ROI. This brings the effective ROI to 4% for the compounded amount, enabling users to accelerate their earnings over time. There is an exciting new feature that will enhance users' investment experience and provide a fair opportunity for all. With this feature, investors who join our platform after 1st August 2023, 04:00 PM UTC will begin earning a remarkable 4% daily reward on their investments. This initiative is designed to provide a fair chance for those who enter the DApp a few days after the initial launch. To maintain stability and prevent potential contract draining, the DApp implements an Anti-whale feature. The Sniper Fund Reward Cut-Off feature serves as an anti-whale mechanism, requiring users to withdraw their earnings within 10 days. If a user fails to do so, the feature stops generating further rewards until the earnings are withdrawn. This promotes fair distribution and doesn't allow whales to accumulate their funds and withdraw all at once, leading to contract draining. Instead, users are encouraged to utilize the compound feature to maximize their ROI. The Snyper Fund DApp offers a Referral program to incentivize user participation and growth. Users can refer the DApp to new users,"

Withdrawing will reset your bonus to 0. Earn 0% when someone uses your referral link! Frequently Asked Questions What is the BNB Crops Farmers? The BNB Crops Farmer is a decentralized application built on the Binance Smart Chain. The object of the game is to hire more farmers sooner and more often than other farmers. This in turn earns you more BNB faster. These Farmers work for you tirelessly, giving you a daily average of 6% of your farmers' value. The daily percentage return depends on farmers' actions that are taken within the platform that impact the farmers's efficiency rate. The farming efficiency rate rises and falls as users buy Farmers, re-hire your earnings and sell your Crops for BNB. Once Farmers are Bought, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to re-hire them (either through hire or re-hiring) cannot be taken back. However, once bought, Farmers will not stop producing yield. What makes it different from other similar platforms? The BNB Crops Farmer has several anti-dumping and anti-whale measures in place to ensure the longevity of the project. These measures include maximum deposits, as well as a cutoff time AND a cooldown time for withdrawals. The cutoff time is the amount of time it will take for your 'cart' to be full of rewards. Once the bag is full, it will stop filling until you've taken some action in the game. This is to prevent whales from letting their rewards accumulate for a long time, and removes the false impression the contract value is going up when most of it is rewards the whale is waiting to withdraw at once. The withdraw cooldown time is the amount of time one has to wait before they can make another withdrawal. This also prevents the contract balance from decreasing in value too fast. If the team decides it's necessary to protect the contract balance, this time period can be adjusted to slow down the rate of withdrawals, but it can only be set to a value less than or equal to 24 hours (per contract rules). The compound count is the number of times"

By default, the required compound count by the platform is 10, meaning the user will have to compound 10 times(compound once every 12 hours) before they can withdraw without the feedback tax of 80%. This feature in essense will ensure the longevity and stability of the project. To reward users who compound, there is a bonus when you re-hire your daily crops earnings instead of selling them. The bonus increases 2% every 12 hours that you compound without withdrawing (20% max after 5 days). This incentivizes the user to compound more often, which will help boost the farms efficiency rate in the long run. To be able to utilize the re-hire bonus feature, the player must not compound before the provided timer reaches 00:00:00. For the farmers who choose to not play the game and only sell, there will be a 80% tax on those sells that will stay in the contract. If the player makes two or more consecutive sells, this tax will be applied. The only way for the user to not pay the 80% tax is to compound 10 times before making another withdrawal. BNB Crops Farmer also has a very unique feature that has never been done before which effectively decreases the amount of farmers inflation that occurs over a long period of time. Every sell action will only add 50% of the amount sold to the total supply. Older miner add 100% of what is sold to the total supply. This means the contract will have a lower inflation rate, keeping the farmers supply more scarce and more valuable than other miner platforms. How does this platform work? This platform work similarly to a financial market, where an asset has intrinsic value that is relative to the supply or demand of said asset. Farmers are purchased with a pre-determined currency at a price relative to the Farmers's current farming efficiency rate. After the Farmers are purchased, they go to work for you right away to give you the best yield on your investment possible, for as long as possible. Just as any other asset bought and sold on an open market, the price of a Farmers will fluctuate over time, as will"

To put it plainly, the more demand for the Farmers, the more they will increase in value and the more yield they will produce. Inversely, when the demand decreases, so will the value of the Farmers and their daily return on investment. The main difference between a this game and a traditional financial market is that a recruited Farmers cannot be sold, only the value they provide can be sold. As the farmers of the game as a whole compound their earnings and make new deposits, the game efficiency rate will stay relatively constant, but the moment farmers start to sell more than they are compounding, the efficiency rate will begin to drop as to preserve the TVL and longevity of the game. What is the recommended strategy? The best strategy that the team can recommend is to re-hire/compound for 6 days and harvest 1 day a week. This will increase the users investment at the same time increasing the daily yield earnings.
